A few years ago, here at TED, Peter Skillman presented a design problem called the "began.
And the idea is pretty simple.
Echipe on how many four, we need to build the most structure of self-stand-to-stand-s-spaghets, a winter, a winter and a tosses.
Beua needs to sit up.
And it looks quite simple, it's quite hard, it's actually quickly, because they're forces to collaborate very quickly.
And so I thought that this is an interesting idea, and I've got this interesting, and I've got it into a set of design.
And it was a great successful.
And since then, we've almost 70s all over the world with students and designers and architects and architects and architects in the top 50 Fortune, and something from this exercise of collaboration, and I'd like to make you split.
So, normally people begin through the task.
It's about it, it's going to show, it's fighting for power, and then they spend a while planning.
Sches and they're arrange and they spend the majority of the time assembly assembly in the structures that they've don't have time, and it's delicated.
It's work.
But what's actually happening, in most of the case, is that "it" transform, "it turns it into a" oh "because the business weight of the business is making the whole structure structure to go.
And there's a number of people who have a lot more moments "oph-oh" than others, and there's most undeeply of the business.
They're mind, cheating, they're lose their concentration, and they make jalnic structures.
And of course, I'm the team that have a lot more structures, "and, among the best, they're graduates of graduate.
And it's pretty amazing.
So as Peter telling us, not only they make the most interesting structures, but also the most interesting one of all.
So you'd like to ask: How do they?
And Peter had to say, "None of children don't lose time trying to be director generally at SRL." That's.
And they don't lose time fighting for power.
But there's also another reason.
This is that students are instruists to find the only corectly, right?
And they're doing it.
And what's happening, when I put began, I'm in the top of time, and what happens?
It's a crisis.
All right? That's known?
What they do differently, is that they're doing is that they're beginning with business, and they build prototypes, successive, so there's a lot more occasions to remediate the wrong protoday.
So designers recognizing this kind of collaboration as the essence of iterative process.
And every version, the kids have an immediately response to what works and what works and what it doesn't work.
So to build in prototype is essential, and let's essential, and let to see how the different teams behavior.
So the average of majority is about 20 countries, students, they're about half, avocations, a little bit better, but not much, the kids of the adults.
Who is the best?
architects and engineers, happiness, the highest structure that I saw a 39.
And why is it so? Because they understand that triangles and geometrical models are the key construction of the stable structures.
So, general directors, a little bit better than the media.
But here becomes interesting.
If you add team a man from administratively improving meaningful meaningful.
It's incredible. You see, you're looking around and say, "That's the win."
Can you say that before. And why is it?
Because they have aptitudes of special facility.
They make the process, I understand the process.
And every team that monitoring and it's attention to work will improve their performance.
Competences and facilitation, and their combination, and their combination leads to successful success.
If you have 10 teams they're starting to build, you're going to have a six structures that they're going to stop.
And we tried something interesting.
I thought, let's growing up.
And I've offered a 10 thousand dollars in informatical programs to the win programs.
And what do you think happened to those students at design?
What was the result?
Here's what happened.
No team didn't built something to sit in legs.
If a team would have built, to say, a three centimeter, a structure of three centimeter, it would have been able to take the prize.
So, isn't, it's really interesting that thousands have a strong impact?
We repeated the exercise with the same students.
What do you think happened?
It's now made the value of the prototype.
And the same team was the world's largest result to one of the best results.
They've got the highest structure in the most short time.
So here's some profound lessons for us about the nature of motivations and success.
So, you may ask: Why do you lose a problem like this?
And the reason is, I helped to create digital instruments and processes that they're building machines and video games.
And what's doing this challenge of began is that it helps hiddentification.
Because, in fact, every project has the drink, isn't it?
This challenges sure a common experience, a common language, a common to building a matter of the right prototype.
And so, this is the value of this experience, this is so simple.
And for those interested, you can accessful wwwww.com. It's a good where you can see how to build with begin.
They're also instructions step about this step.
They're also unusual examples of all over the world of how people change the system.
You can find the world records.
And the fundamental lesson, I think it's the fact that design is really a sport of contact.
We're to dedicate the tasks all of the senses, and to apply the challenge of the challenge in front of us.
And sometimes, a simple prototype of this experiences is the only necessary to transform a moment of oh-oh. "
And that makes the difference.
Thank you very much.
Let's assume that there's a machine, a big machine, former TED, which is a time.
And all of us in this room has to go into it.
You can go back or forward, but you can't stay, but you can't stay.
I ask me ask, because you asked this question, because I asked my friends this question in the last time, and they all wanted to go back in time.
I don't know. I'm going to go back before the automobile, before Twitter or "American Idol."
I don't know.
I'm sure there's a particular attraction.
But I have to mention that I'm not part of this group.
I don't want to go back to time and not because I'm not the spirit of adventure, but it's because this planet doesn't regresates, but it's advances.
So, I want to go before.
It's the best period of this planet in every private point of view: health, wealthy, ricity, richness, ricity, richness, richness,
It didn't have a period.
Now, all of my grandparents died before it's 60 years.
My grandped up to 70.
My parents are close to 80.
So it would be good, there's the nine of the age that I'm going to die.
But it's not even about people like new, because it's much more important than that.
A child who's born today in New Delhi has a higher hope of life than he had the richer in the world 100 years ago.
Think about it. It's an incredible phenomenon.
And why is it true?
Varola. Varola billion people.
He reprofiled the demographic data in a unequality of anything else.
It's no longer. It's gone.
I've got it. Can!
In the rich, the diseases that have millions of people with just a generation, there's no longer there.
Difteria, the polio, polio.
It's somebody knows what all of this?
Vaccines, the modern drugs, our capacity to feed billions of people are methods of scientific methods.
And I think of scientific method, to put things on the attempt, whether it's going to see whether it's changes if it doesn't, it's changes if it doesn't, it's actually changing whether it's changing whether it "it 'it" it "it"
These are good news.
Unfortunately, there's no other issues because there's other issues, there's a lot of times, one billion people colls every day.
This number is growing very quickly and it's so quickly.
It's not just so, but we've used imagination to destroy this planet.
They're potable, the agricultural, the rainforest, the rainforest: they're all going to go away.
If we don't invent a way to go out of this encourage, we're going to be available.
The question is: Can we do it.
I think it's obvious that we can produce food billions of people without the devastation that I live.
I think we can food this world with energy that it's not going to destroy.
I really believe that and it's not just an illusion.
But here's what I don't leave me night -- one of the things that I don't let.
We've never had a bigger need the progress of science than now, we've ever been in the situation to use it in the way we can do today.
We're in the top of absolutely amazing events.
However, I think we should go back to three hundreds of years in time, before Epoca Islightly, to discover a period where we fighted for progress, for all of these things with more force and more fronts than now.
People's crampones of their convince, that it's not release.
It's not going to release.
Everybody's right to an opinion; the right has an opinion about progress, but you know what?
You don't have the right to your right to your own truths. I'm sorry, but it's this.
And it took some time to figure this.
Now, a 10 years ago, I wrote an article about vaccines for "The New Yorker" a small article. "
We've been wonderful to be part of appropriate, and we've been away from what, the most efficient measure public health history.
I didn't know what to do, so I've done, I've done an article and I've done.
As after that, I wrote an article about food food.
The same thing, only more important.
People too.
So I wrote an article and that I couldn't understand why people thought it was, "food guy", why they thought it changes the molecules in a particular way, it doesn't have a choice, it means.
But as you know, I'm doing what I'm doing. I wrote the article, I wrote.
I'm just a journalist; we're type, we're going to field, we're going to field.
But these articles, and I didn't figure out why. And then I understood.
It was because those fantastic because of those fanatic were not at all.
They were people with good people, educated, to their place.
They were exactly like people in this room.
And he deranjured so much --
but then I thought, let's be honest.
We are in the point where we don't have the same relationship to now.
We're talking about it ambivalent.
We're talking about it in ironic terms, and we put it between: "Progress."
OK, there's reasons for that, and I think we know what these reasons.
We've lost in institutions, in authority and sometimes even in science.
And we have the right to do it.
You can pleasure a few name and people will understand.
Cern, Bhopal, Bhopal, ship Challenger, Vioxxx, mass distringly numbers of voting.
You can choose your own list.
They're asking questions at the people that I thought they've always been right.
So, being circumstances.
You're asking questions and proved.
You didn't take anything good.
But here's the idea: when you get evidence, you have to accept it. We don't really well. We don't really pricing it.
And I can tell it because we're in the midddimensions of the news of the nemassive dimensions until that I'm in the middle.
Now, about 12 years ago, it's been published an article, which was the connection between autism and the vaccine of autism and the vaccine and rubusiness.
Very frightening.
They've done these studies to verify whether this is true.
They really had to do it for studies; it's a big problem.
They come and the results.
Results in the United States, in Britain, from Sweden Canada, and all of the same thing: there's no corelationship, absolutely no way.
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter, because we think what we're seeing, because we think what we see, what we're seeing, what we're doing to feeling us.
We don't believe a lot of document from a government functionary functionary functionary functionary functionary functional works and understand this, I think we all understand.
What about it?
The results were disaster, and here's why, the United States is one of the few countries in the world in which vaccines against rujoly is in shared.
That's unfinished, it should be shame.
It's terrible.
What happened here?
I understand, I really understand.
Is somebody's there?
He saw someone in the audience of the audience ever dirt of the pojar?
It doesn't really happen.
In this country, it's not happened, but 160,000 times around the world's last year.
A lot of deaths because of the people, 20 per hour.
But, because here didn't happen, we can't think about it and people like Jenny McCarthy McCarthy.
And I can do that because they don't do it because they don't do the difference between cause.
They don't understand that they're not coincide.
And we need to learn that soon.
This guy, Jonas Sulk, was a hero.
It's got down to one of the biggest born of humanity.
Without, no agony, polio has gone.
The guy in the middle -- not too.
He called the Paul Offit.
It's just developed a vaccine against a vaccine together with each other.
Salvate 400,000 lives of children in the developing world every year.
Bun result, isn't it?
It's good, it's just that Paul talks about vaccines and how they're supposed to begin.
Even so formulate.
So, Paul is a terrorist.
When Paul speaks into a public audience, it can't deposition without armed by the armen.
It's called hhome because people like to say I know what school is going to say I know what to school go.
Why? Because Paul did a vaccine.
I don't need to say that, but vaccines are essential.
If you're moving them, horrible diseases, and that's what's happening now.
In this country, we've now.
It's from what's worse again, the kids will die from that, because it's a statistic problem.
And they won't just going to die of routes.
What about polio? Let's have to stay. Why not?
Now two weeks ago, there was a college of college wrote and told me that they're kind of strident.
No one said that.
He didn't have to spot their child against polio.
In any case.
All right.
Why? Because we don't have polio. You know anything?
Yesterday, there were no polio case in this country.
Today, I don't know, maybe a guy have a type of Lagos Angeles, and it's going to land on the airport of the Ohio.
It's going to land over two hours, it's going to be in Long Beach, and it's going to be in Long Beach night.
It doesn't know that it's infected with a challenging disease, and we don't know, because it works.
That's the planet that we live. Let's not that.
We like to teach our mines. We like to teach our.
He took everybody vitamins of the vitamins?
Echinition, a little antioxidant to function.
I know you've done because half of the population makes this day.
They're going to do this and the alternative medicine, and it doesn't matter how often we're completely useful.
The data looks like every time.
They make them closer to color, and usually, nothing more.
It's okay, you want to pay 28 billion dollars for color.
You don't.
Look at color.
Why do we do that?
I think I understand -- I think we've got the big farmaceutical producers.
We have the government. We're not trust.
And we shouldn't have to have to be. Our public health.
It's crude to millions of people.
It's incredibly recognizer and it's incredibly reaching it.
And so fugee. And so there's fugee?
Drepresenting the arms of placebo.
It's fantastic. I love great.
But, in fact, it's something very seriously because things are some smile, and we spend on the billions of dollars.
I've got all kinds of decision.
No one of them -- ginkey, the network, slightly that's none of them, I don't even know what it is, but we spend billions of dollars on this.
And you know anything? When I say, people'm saying, "What do you care?"
Do you know anything? You know?
Because I don't care if the secretary of the Ministry is the one who says, "Hmm, they don't take the evidence of the mographs of mographs," or there's a charlatan. "
When you're watching on the way that belief and the magic, and the magic, you don't want to be in a place where you don't want to find out.
You get in South Africa of Thabo Mbeki.
She killed 400,000 people insisting that sfecto red the red, the rocket is much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs that we know slower slowly slowly slowly to the AIDS progress.
Hundreds of thousands of gratured in a devastated country more than any other disease of this disease.
Please, I don't tell me that there's no consequences for that.
There's always.
The most missed epidemic sense of epidemic that's actually this right now is this absurprisoners of the genetic modified and the sussive elites.
It's a break. It's got to start.
It's a words of words at words, at metaphor.
It's ideology, not science.
Whatever I eat, every stream of the rich, every squared of Bruxelles was changed by man.
In the Edense of Edense.
And there's no yellow.
There were no Christmas. We've done.
We've done in the last 1,000 years.
Some of them were rule, not.
I've don't.
Now we can do it in a way.
Sure, there's risks.
But we can put the vitamine A, and that can help millions of people, and that can help millions of people, taking their lives.
You don't want to do that?
I've got to get that I don't understand.
We're Protesting against genetic modified.
Why do we do that?
Well, I'm always hearing things like, like a lot of chemicals, pesticides, hormonocultures, we don't want surfaces, it's wrong.
We don't want companies to break the life.
We don't want companies to deal.
You know what my answer is to all of this?
Yeah, you're right. Let's take this.
So there's a big problem with food, but that's not science.
This is nothing to do with science.
It's deality, it's morality.
You know that science is not a company.
It's not a country.
It's not even an idea; it's a process.
It's a process that sometimes works, and chooses, but the idea that we should not affordable to them because it's fear, because it's fear and stop millions of people to prosption.
In the next 50 years, we're going to produce 70 percent more food than in the present.
70 percent.
Here's what investment did in Africa from the last 30 years.
Rusiness. Ruinous.
They need this, and we don't.
Why size genetic modified.
We don't want to encouraging people to eat the bodies like food.
500 million people eat food.
It's kind of like a card.
Just the calories. It's terrible.
It's no nutritive, no protein, and it doesn't have proteins, and the scientists, right now.
And then people will be able to eat it without orbit.
They're not going to be hungry and you know anything?
It's going to be good. It would Chez Panisse, but it would be good.
Everything I can say is: Why do we fit?
Let's asking this question: Why do we fit?
Because we don't want to change the genes?
It's just about changing genes. It's not about chemicals.
It's not about our passion ridiculous passion for hormones, about insistence of high food, about higher dimensions, much better food, particular food.
It's not about the little time for the little bit of the way, it's humans in life and came time to understand what this means.
Because, you know what?
If we don't do it, if we're going to do it, we're going to be guy for something that I don't think we want to be wove, and it's colonization.
We can't describes what's happening.
It's an egot, it's high, it's huge, and we really need to start.
So, after this incredibly distractive discussion, "So you're just going to go in this car charags of the time to travel in the future?"
Of course. Sure he's sure.
Now, it's now, but we have an amazing opportunity.
We can programs the car of time we want.
We can move anywhere we want, and that's what we're going to do.
We've got to wear these discussion, and we need to think, but when we go before, we go before, we go before, we're doing it.
I know that we're going to do this is to need the world now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
One day day day, Steve Lopez Times from Los Angeles Times's focus when he heard a beautiful music.
And he was a man, a man, an African-American, delight-American, unknowledged, a man of foreign, which was only two coards.
And I'm telling you a lot of you know, because Steve wrote a lot of articles that became a film, with Robert Downey Jamie Steve Lopez, and Jamie Fox like Steve Lopez, and Jamie Fox like Nathony Ayan Egthon-Daashanish. Aian Enaashamie Aian Lian Lian Lian Egthonthonthonthonthony Aanananishanananananananananism,,,,, Bence Canism Lowney Aanism Lian Lananism Lave Lathonthonthonthonthony Achanananananananananananananananananan
Nathaniel has taken up to school, went through a toilet, and it's 30 years later, and 30 years later, lived on the streets of Skid Row in the center.
I'm giving you all to read the book of Steve't just beautiful to understand not only the beautiful connection that has been formed between these two people, but how music has helped to the formation of the instrument, and until was instrumental.
I met on Ayers in 2008, two years ago, two years ago, the Walt Disney.
You're listening to interpretation of the symphonies and fourth of Bethoven and came into the back of the scene, and it's been presented.
He's talking in a very game and sociable way about Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yoh May.
I've been talking about music. I received an email from Steve a few days later said, "Nathaniel was interested in a living.
Now, I've got to mention that Nathaniel refused to treatment because when he was doing was a therapy of shock and therapy, and this cycles, and that cycles, and that has leved the cycles.
But as a result now, it's prevent to these schizophrenic episodes.
The worst of them can manifests like him exploding, and it's available, the streets of Skid Row, exposed to those cities, with those tors, with its headquarters of releasing.
And Nathaniel was very agited when we first began to the Walt Disney had a kind of well-being in terms, was lost.
And he was talking about invisible demonstrate and a girls, and how someone stops it in sleep.
And it was fear, not for me, but it was fear that I'm going to lose, that I'm going to deal in one of his states, and I'm going to talk about flip and waste and other forms of pedagogy.
So I started to play.
And I played the first part of the concert for Bethoven.
And as I've done understood that a profound in the eyes of Nathaniel.
It's like if it was under the influence of invisible drugs, a chemical reaction, which was music.
And the manner of Nathaniel's has been tranformed in understanding, a quick and graphics.
And as a miracle, he raised his own vian, and he started to play, after the ears, and he began to play, Mendelsssing, Mendelssshn, Mendelssshn, Tchaikovsky, Sibelius.
And we started talking about music, from Bach to Bach Bach to Bruckner, and Bruckner, Bruckner, and Bruckner, all of Bards from Esa-Peka Salonen.
And I understood that he didn't only had an encyclopedical knowledge about music, but he had a personal connection with music.
He was talking about that passion and understanding that I sharing with my colleagues from Los Angeles in Los Angeles.
And while we've gone and I was speaking this man transformed from a paranoid paranoid, which was just come from a paranoid of Los Angelession, in this slightly musician, genially, educated, genially, educated to Juilliard.
Music is therapy. Music is therapy.
And for Nathaniel, music is psychological health.
Because music, allows them to take their thoughts and illusions, and transform them through the imagination and creativity, in reality.
And that's an evadation of his suffering.
And I understood that's the essence of art.
That's why we do music, we take something that exists in ourselves, in our fundamental, our emotions, our emotions, and with our artistic video, with our artistic creativity, with our emotions in reality.
And the reality of that express us all, and it impresses us, and it impress us, and inspiring us.
And for Nathaniel, he brought him back to my friends.
The power of the freedom of the musicians brought it into a musicians that understanding him, and they recognize it.
I'm always going to do music with Nathaniel, whether we're in the Walt Disney, or in Skid Row, because it remember why I've become musician.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Thank you.
Robert Gupta.
Robert Gupta: I'm going to play anything that we sed without the violonists.
So, I'm going to pleasure you.
I'm Jane McGonigal. I'm a game designer.
I'm doing online of 10 years old.
And my goal for the next decade is to try to light the world in real life as it can save the world in real lives.
Now, I've got a plan for that, and it's including the world, including people here, to spend more time playing games and better.
We're going to spend three billion a week of hours online games.
Some of you may think, "It's very much time spent playing games."
Maybe too long time, we've got to solve in the real world.
However, my research to the Institute For Viitor, is exactly on the door of Viitor, is exactly on the door.
Three billion hours on the room is not nearly enough for game to solve the world.
In fact, I think, if we want to survive the century on this planet, we have to grow this planet, we need to grow this number of hours.
We've calculated the top that we need to 21 game every week.
So, this is probably an intuitive idea.
So I'm going to say it again, I'm going to leave.
If we want to resolve problems like foamed, poverty, poverty, poverty, global conflicts, the global conflicts, obesity, I think we need to aspiry about 21 billion hours. They're serious. They're serious. They're serious. They "
Here's why. This picture is what I believe that games are so essential for the future survival species for the future of the species of human survive.
This is a portrait's a photograph called Phil Toledano.
He wanted to capture the emotion of play.
So he showed a camera in front of players, while these played.
And this is a classical emotion.
Now, if you're not a gamer may be able to lose one of this photographs.
You'll probably not-action needs, fear, but intense concentration, powerful attention to a very difficult problem.
If you're a player, you'll see a couple of slightly slightly slightly stoptimism.
And the brobroads are a surprise of surprise.
This is a gamer that's close to something called an epic.
Oh, you've heard about it. OK. OK.
So we've got some gams of us.
One won's a result that is so extraordinarily positive that you don't touching until you won't get it until you won't win.
It was almost beyond the limits of imagination.
And when you get there's so shocked to discover that you're really capable. This is a win.
This is a way to get an epic.
And that's the face that we need to see at the millions of people who solve problems all over the world as we're trying to remove the future of the future century.
It's taken that, it's on the way to get a win.
Now, unfortunately, this is a face that we're seeing in life with day, as we get ourselves of huge problems.
This is what I call the "I'm not good at live."
And here I'm quite, making this face. You can see? Yeah. OK.
That's actually me doing "I'm not good at living."
Here's a piece of graffiti in my team.
from Berkley, California, where I took the doctorator of the reasons that we're better in real life than in real life.
And that's a problem that many gamers.
We feel that we're not as good in reality as we are in the games.
And I don't mean, "successful" successful "successful" successful "in the real life than in the real life, but when I say it'm saying, inspired to color and cooperate.
And when we're in virtual world, I think a lot of us greatest version of us, the most likely to help at a moment, the most likely to focus on a problem that it's needed, to try and.
In real life, when we're putting in real life, when we're confront with the obstacles, when we're confronted with the obstacles, we don't feel like that.
We're feelings.
We feel anxious, you may depressed, or field.
We don't have such a feelings when we play, they're just not in games.
So that's what I wanted to study when I finished my college.
What is in games of games makes the feeling impossible that it's nothing we can do?
How can we take these feelings of games of games and apply them to work in real life?
So, I looked at games like World of Warcraft, which is really a truly of collaboration for solving problems.
And I began to notice a few things that do so win in the online world.
So the first thing is that is, whenever you go into one of these online games in the World of Warcraft, you meet a lot of characters that would save the world, immediately,
But not any mission, but it's a perfect mission with your levels in the game. Right?
So, you can take it to fit.
They're never once that you can't fall.
But that's at the limitation of what you can do. So, you have to be a lot.
But there's not there's in World of Warcraft.
There's no losing state and loss.
There's always something clear to do.
And also, they're also tons of collaborators.
Everywhere you go, hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to leave yourself to leave you to swim for your little mission.
It's not something that's possible with real life, this feeling that you're in real life, this feelings of collaborators.
And in addition, it's this epic story, this is inspiration of inspiration about why we are and what we're doing.
And then you get all this positive feedback.
You'll have heard of growth in the growth, and it's a lot of intelligence.
We don't get constant feedback in real life.
When I'm going to go on this stage, I'm not going to have gone to talk and full of ideas live.
I don't get feedback in real life.
Now, the problem with online of collaboration, like World of Warcraft is that it's so satisfy to be on the point of the time that we decide to spend all the time in these virtual world.
It's just more than that in reality.
So, until now, in collectively all the World of World of Warcraft have spent 5.93 million years solving the virtual problems of Azeros.
Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing.
It could sound like a bad thing.
But to put this in context: 5.93 million years ago was the moment that our first ancestor human stood stood stood.
That's been the first first first that stood in legs.
Okay, so when we're talking about how long we're talking about the games, the only way we're going to think about time at this, is what an extraordinary, which is an extraordinary thing.
But it's also appropriate. Because it's a spending so long time playing games, we actually change what we're able to do as human beings.
We're evolving to a more collaborative and more imownership.
That's true. I believe.
So, you take this interesting statistics.
It was published by a recently from a Carnegie Mellon Carnegie Mellon.
The Medies of people today in a country with a strong culture with a strong culture of a powerful games will have spent 10,000 hours of honline to the age of 21-year-old game.
Now, 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of two reasons.
First of all, for children in the United States 10.0.0-hours is the number exactly the number that you're going to spend hours, and until you're never in hours.
So we've got a parallel of education that's happening in which people are as much about what it is needed to be a good gamer gamer as the rest of the rest.
And some of you've probably read the new book of Malcom Gladwell, called Outliers.
So, you've already heard of his theory about 10,000 successfully success.
It's based on the same extraordinary research on the cognitive field that says that if we can sol10,000 hours of age, we're going to be specialists on that subject.
We're going to be as good at whatever in the world.
And so, what we're looking now is a whole generation of young people who are players specialized.
So, the great question is, "What's going to be so good?"
Because if we could figure out this, we have a humanity practical resource at available.
Here's how many people have now in the world that spend a day playing an hour today playing online games.
These are our gams of experts.
500 million people who are extraordinary to something.
And in the future future, we're going to have a billion players that are extraordinarily extraordinarily.
If you don't already know, it comes.
The industry of the developing develop confidence, and it works on the bases of wireless energy and it works on the network of wireless in the world in India, China, Brazil, China, Brazy, is connecting online.
They're still estimate one billion gamers in the decade.
That's going to bring us to 1.5 billion players.
So I began to think about what these experts do.
These are the four things that we discovered. The first is the optimism.
Okay. Think about this as an extreme motivation.
Optimism of urgent is the desire to act in front of an obstacle, combined with the faith of an obstacle.
Gamerations always thought that a win is possible, and it's always that they're always going to try, and it's worth always.
Juckers don't know.
Gamerations are experts at the bottom of a powerful social tissue.
There's a lot of studies that shows that we like a game with them, even if we play a game with them, even though they've got a game with them.
And the reason is that it's necessary is necessary to play a game with someone.
We've got that someone is going to spend his time with us, that will play after the same rules, they're going to play the end.
And so, playing together a game with someone actually building and cooperation and cooperation and cooperating and cooperation.
And as a result, we build more powerful social relationships.
It produced happy. I love that.
You know, there's a reason that average for the World of Warcraft play 22 hours a week, think about a partial jobs.
It's because you know, when we play a game, that we're even happier working hard, than when we get our friends.
We know we're optimized that we're optimized as human beings.
And the players are willing to work hard all the time, if they're getting work.
Well, it's epic.
Juckers love to be attached by missions that inspiring respect of stories in the planetary scale.
So, just a little trivia to help us see things in perspective.
So, you all know Wikipedia, the biggest wiki in the world.
The second wiki biggest wiki, with about 80,000 articles is World of Warcraft.
Five millions of people use it every month.
They have a lot more information about World of Warcraft across the Internet than any other wiki subject treated in any other wiki in the world.
They're building a little story.
They're building an equally of knowledge about World of Warcraft.
OK, so there's this super four power that happens in one thing.
Gamers are powerful individuals and hope.
They're people who believe that are individual capable to change the world.
And the only problem is that they think they're capable to change the world, but not the real world.
This is the problem I'm trying to solve.
It's an economist called Edward Castrono.
his work is genial. He studies why people investing so long and energy and money in virtual world.
And he says, "We're martors at what's happening [nothing less than a mass exood in the vironline of game."
She's an economist. So it's rational.
And he says, "I'm a game of games and I'm exuberant.
But he says, that this has a clear because players can get more in online, because players can get more in the online world than they can get in life.
They can have more powerful social relationships in real life than in real life.
They get better girls and they're feeling better feeling in the games than in real life.
So, he says that now, has a sense to spend more time in virtual world than in the real world than in the real world than the real world.
Now, and I'm like this is rational, for the moment.
But it's not, in any optimal situation.
We have to start doing the real world more like a game.
So, I'm inspiration from something happened 2.500 years ago.
These are the ancy of the snails. Right?
Before we had extraordinary controllers, we had extraordinary open.
And that's the first game of the game of human beings.
And if you're familiar with the work of hard Herodot, you may know this story.
That is the history of the history that has invented games and why.
Herodot said that games, and particular games, have been invented in the World War at a moment of foameons.
Aparently, it was so big foametes of Lydia decided that he had to do something crazy.
People suffered. People were fighting.
It was an extreme situation. They needed a extreme solution.
So, Herodot's invented, they have invented games and defined a value of the regular.
One day, each of them will eat.
And in the next day, everyone will play.
And they're going to be so concentrated on games because games are so solicitances and taught us in a satisfying satisfying that they didn't have what eat.
And so in the next day, they're games, and they'll eat.
And it's Herodotus, lived like this 18, surviving a hungry food when you playing games in one day and playing games in the other.
Now, that's exactly, I think, the way we use games today.
We use games to get rid of the real world.
We use games to run everything that's stricted in real environment, all that's not satisfy about our lives, and we get what we need in games.
But it doesn't have to end here.
This is very interesting.
Herodot's hodot, after 18, after 18-year-old foamework.
So the rates decided that they're going to play a game of fars.
They've divided all over two.
They've played a game of zars, and the winners got the chance to go into a epical adventure.
They will leave Lydia.
And they're going to go to a new place in which to live, leaving exactly how many people to survive to survive with the resources that were more available, and hoping to drive others where they could.
Now, that sounds crazy, isn't that?
But recently, DNA showed that etruscrowed the Roman, had the same DNA as well as the old of Lydia.
And so, the researchers have suggested that fantastic story of Herodot could be true.
And geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that took almost 20 years, and it could have explain foamor.
So, this crazy story could be true.
They could even save their culture playing games, to get out of games, to go through games for 18-year-old games, and then to know how to uniquely unlock through games games that they saved the entire civilization in this way.
OK, we can do that.
We play Warcraft in 1994.
That was the first game of strategy in real time in the World of Warcraft. This was 16 years ago.
They played games for 18, we've been played Warcraft for 16.
I'm saying that we're ready now for our Epic game.
Now, they've had half-civilization that went to set a new world.
So, here's where I'm 21 billion game on week.
Let's going to do it to convince half of us to play a half an hour video games to play a half an hour video games until we solve the problems.
Now I know you ask, "How can we ask," How can we solve the problem of life in games? "Well, that's the theme of the last years, to the Vial Institute for Vify.
We've got this banner in Palo Alto and expressing the future of Palo Alto and expressing the future.
We don't want to try to predict the future.
What we want to do is to create the future.
We want to imagine the best scenario.
And then we're going to put people to transform this stage in reality.
We're going to imagine the epick win, and then to the middle people to get these epical win.
I want to show you very shortly three of games that we've done that we've done who's in their future.
So, that's the May of Petrol.
We created this game in 2007.
This is a game online game where you're trying to survive a oil of oil.
The oil crisis, but we've asked enough content there so that you can think it's real, so you can think it's real as if we don't have any more oil as they come in this scale, you say where you live.
And then we're transmitting your video in real time of data that looks exactly how much oil costs the oil, which isn't available, how it's not available, like food is affected, if they're protests.
And you have to imagine how you've lives, you're all true. And then we're going to write in a blog about this, to publish pictures.
We've tested this game in 2007,
And I've been watching three years since.
And I can tell you that it's an experience that is a transform you.
Nobody wants to chembart the way of life because it's good for the world, or because it is good for the world, or because they need.
But if you're include in a epc adventure and you say, "We'll stay without oil."
That's a fantastic and a fantastic adventure in which to share.
Let me challenge to see how you have survive.
Most of our players have supported habits that they've learned in this game.
So, for the future that can save the world, we decided to keep on problems more high than oil.
AM created a game called Superstruct at the Institute for Viitor.
And the premise was that a calculator of calculator has just 23 years of spent on this planet.
The Supercomputer was called the Global System consciousness of itself, of course.
We asked people to come online close online on a film of Jerry Bruckheimer.
You know Jerry Bry's video Bruckheimer, there's a dream team.
You're the astronautor, scientist, the prisoner, and they're all in the world.
But in our game, instead of being only five people in this dream of dream, I said that everybody's in our dream, and it's the future of social, the future of social.
AM had 8,000 people who played this game for eight weeks.
They've invented 500 solutions that you can see whether you're going to see if you go online and search for "on Google."
So, in the fine, the last game, we're playing in three march. That's a game created in collaboration with the World Bank Institute like a Social Inovor like a Social Inovor like a Social Inovor as a Social, the 2010.
And by working with university in all of the sub-Saharan Africa, and we're inviting social innovation techniques.
We've got a graphic roman.
I'd like to invite all of you to share this game with people anywhere in the world, especially in the developing areas that could benefit from the development that could benefit from their own social companies that would save the world.
So now I'm going to solve.
I want to ask you something.
What do you think it will happen now?
We have all of these amazing players, we have these amazing games that are a kind of a pilot versions that we could do, but none of them didn't saved the world yet.
Well I hope you're going to agree with me that players are a human resource that we can use to work for the real world, that games are a powerful platform.
We all have these amazing superpower, productivity, the ability to take a solid of social relationship of social relationships, this feeling of optimism, and to have an epic.
I'm hope from soul that we can play games that matters, to survive on this planet to survive on this planet for another century.
And it's my hope that you're going to make games like these.
When I'm thinking about the future, I know two things with certainly that we can make any future games.
So, I'm saying, to start games that changes the world.
Thank you.
For some time I'm interested in the placebo effect, which would seem strange for a magician, just if you think about it, and it's, which is, "there's a real thing."
Otherwise, the pills with a sugar effect in certain kinds of studies, just because the person think what's happening is, because the person think what's happening is a farmacetic or like --
For pain, for example, if it's believe, in the body has a measurable effect called the placebo effect called the placebo effect.
Something false becomes something real.
To telling us, I want to start by showing you a roude, a very simple trick.
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick that you find every book for children in 1950.
And I've learned from Cub Magic Scout in 1970.
I'm going to show you and then explain it.
And then I'm going to explain why I explained it.
So here's what happens.
The cooking, which you can look at it; my hand, you can see it.
I'm going to keep the bottom.
I'm going to go up.
And to make sure that nothing indeed in, or it doesn't come out of my food here.
To see that there's nothing about there.
And as long as they're raised in there, and there's nothing in my hand.
And it's pretty simple.
I'm going to open, and I hope, if it's all well, my magnetism will support the bottom.
In fact, it's so well that I can spend the hand, and the bodidn't head.
It's not circulating anything in the hand, no farse. And you can examine everything.
Take.
I often teaching this kids on the trick of magnets, because you can teach a lot about swim, because you can teach a lot of sharing, even though it's very simple to do.
It's probably probably already know him.
Here's what happens.
They're in the hand.
And I'm saying I'm going to keep sure that I'm not going to get anything on there, it's a wonderful.
The reason I'm in practice is actually the secret of this illusion.
The moment in my hand is moving from front of you, and you don't see it, the finger, the finger will move where it's in front of this gene.
Hi.
On there's a child without childhood.
So, that's how it works here.
And as I'm rotesing, my finger move.
And we can discuss why you don't see, why you don't notice that I'm just three fingers, because it's how information, not in the number, two, three fingers. They're grouping.
But that's not that. It's not that. And then open hand.
Obviously, it's over there, it's not a trick, but through a trick, it's my shower.
And then when the pumnor, the same thing as I'm, the same thing as I'm retragging, the room movement.
I'm getting to one side. And the bottom.
And that's gone you can make friends and the neighbors.
Now, what's the connection with the placebo effect?
I read a study with a year, who opened my mind.
I'm not any researcher, so for me this was amazing.
It turns out, if you administers a placebo in the form of a white pills, it's a white measurable, has a certain effect.
But if you change the form where you're administer, you give a smaller, you're making a little bit of a letter, it has a larger measurable effect.
Although no one of these pills have no pharmaceutical substances -- they're pills with sugar.
But the white pill is not as good as blue as the blue.
How? That's left me.
And it turns out that it doesn't stop here.
If you take capsules, they're more effective than tabletes, in any form.
A colored capsule, the yellow into a head and red on the other one is better than the white capsule capsule.
And with the dog is a stuff.
A pills of two times a day is not as good as a paste of the past -- I'm not in the mind study now.
But the idea is that --
-- and the dog matter.
And until form has something to do with this.
And if you're the most placebo you have to go to the ac.
Yeah? A couple of a couple of centimeter -- a couple of centimeter, and you injects this in a patient --
So it's a powerful picture for them, much more powerful than the white pill.
It's real, well, well, I'm going to show another time I'm going to have a slide.
The idea is that the white pastila is not as good as the blue as the blue, is not as good as a capsule, and it's not as good as a capsulous capsule, and it's not as good as an ac.
And there's no real farmaceutical quality.
It's just our trust a real in our body and produce a more powerful effect.
And I wanted to see if I can apply this idea of a magic magic.
And I'm going to take something that is obviously a fake trick and make him real.
And we know from that study that if you want to reality, you have to use the acle.
That's a seven of seven countries. It's very housing.
And I'm going to steruse it a little bit.
That's my hand. It's no artificial.
That's my skin. It's no Hollywood.
I'm going to find it with this skin.
If you're sensitive -- if you're easy to make it for a few friends in the hotel room, and there were some people I don't know, and it's some people I don't know, and it's almost.
So, I'm sugggesting that if you're going to be able to look in another part of the next minutes -- in fact, you know what, I'm not going to the first part of view.
You'll see, you're going to see you.
So, this is, right here, in this part of the bottom of my arm I'm going to make a little hole.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry?
And now they're now going through the skin, and it's the other way.
Now, we're about the same point as the trick with the bottom.
Something like that.
But now you can't call my fingers, right?
Well, let me show them. Let's show them one, three, four, five.
Yeah, good --
I know what people think about when I see that.
I'm saying, "Well, it's not so good to get us to a few minutes," Wow, take a little bit.
What does this look like? Yeah.
Yeah, I know. And those behind, they're going to say, "Okay. I actually didn't seen this."
Let me show you better.
That's really the skin. It's no Hollywood.
That's my card, and I can stay it.
I'm trying. If you're worse, you don't look at that.
Those behind or those who are going to look at the video that they're going to say, "It's, well, it's a stuff, but if it's a hole there, if it's a hole." Let's make it for you.
Go, here's.
Normally, now I'd drive the across.
I'd put my hand and I'd show that I'm not a rank.
But I think in this context, and with the idea to take something to it in something real, I'll leave it into something real, I'm going to leave it there, and I'm going to go on the stage.
We see a few times days.
I hope it's expect. Thank you very much.
So I met a lot of fish to my life.
We just loved two.
The first was more like a passional business.
It was a beautiful fish, with texture, book, with texture, book, a star.
What fish.
Even better, it's been raised in a farm, it seems, the highest standard standard standard.
So you could feel good when you get it.
I've been in a relationship with this beautiful months.
One day, the director of the company called me and asked me whether I'd speaking to a event sustainability.
"Sure," I said.
Here's a company trying to solve what's becoming this unimagined for our kitems.
How do we keep our fishes on our fishes?
For the past 50 years, we fished in ms and oceans as we've been fished the forests.
It's hard to survive.
90 percent of the sea, the one that we love, the tone that we love, the ton, sleep, the sleep, all of the broken.
They almost disappeared.
So, at good or bad, the aculture, farms, farms fish, it's become part of our future.
They're lots of controversary to acvaculture.
Their fish pollute, at least most of them do, and they have reduced productivity, you see the ton.
A major deficians.
The tone has a rate of conversation of 15 to one.
That means that it's need 15 squared to get a type of tone raised to farm.
It's not too sustainable.
And there's also no bad.
So here's, finally, there was a company to do good.
I wanted to support them.
In the day of the event of the event, we called public relationships in company.
Let's call it Don.
"Don", "I said," just to put things on the point, you're westing because they're growing this far outside, you don't polluthy. "
"Corectly," he says. "We're so far in largely, they're unconcentrated, they're not concentrated."
And then he added, "We're actually a new world.
The conversation of food, 2.5 to one, "he says.
"The best on the market."
2.5 to one, great.
"2.5 to one of what feed you use?"
's "Protes," he said.
"Grozave," I said. I've finished.
And in that night, I was in the bed, and I was thinking: What the hell is a sustainable protein?
So the next day, before events, even before the events, we called Don.
I said, "Don, I'm some examples of sustainable proteins." He said he didn't know.
Well, we've talked to the phone with a few people in the company.
None couldn't have a clear answer.
And finally, I talked to the shoot biologist.
Let's call it Don it.
"Don," I said, "I said," Well, "Well, it mentioned some algae and something fish.
I said, "Well, you know?"
He said, "Yeah, it's, it's bones, bones, and processed in food."
I said, "What's in your food is you put?"
And by thinking, you understand, about a couple of percent.
"Well, it's about 30 percent," he said.
"Don, what's sustainable in the feeding of fishing with business?" I said.
It's been a long break on the line, and he said, "I'm just too many people in the world."
My fish for this fish was shot.
No, it's not because I'd be a particularly virtuous and hipoit.
In fact, they're actually.
No, I felt elated by this fish because, about God, after that conversation, after that conversation, fish, fish, fish,
The second fish, it's another love of love story.
It's the kind of romantic, the kind of that you know, the fish it, the more you love it.
So we eat a restaurant in the southern Southern.
A friend journalist was talking about this fish.
In a way, we've gone to meet us.
He's come to to a white color, narrogs.
The squef broken it too much.
Some times.
Surprisingly, it was delicious.
Who maybe it's a fish to have a fish goal after it was found too much?
I can't, but this guy can.
Let's call it Miguel.
In fact, his name is Miguel.
And he didn't find the fish and he's not a chef.
At least not in the way you and I understand this.
He's a Veta biologist.
It's a farm in the southwest corner of Spain.
It's in the Guadalquivir.
By in the 1980s was in the hands of argentinians.
They've grow up in the area that was actually a swamp.
They've created it by the way.
They've built this complicated channels, and they put the water in the river.
But they couldn't do it to work economic.
And environmental was a disaster.
He's killed 90 percent of the birds, which is a lot of birds.
So in 1982, a Spanish company to buy the land.
What did did?
They've inverted the sense of water.
They've gone to their own.
Instead of push water, they've used canals to bring water.
They've got the canal.
They've created a 1,000 hectarian farm of 1,000 hectarian, babusiness, baby, and in this process Miguel and its company, they're completely environmental effects.
Ferma is incredible.
I mean, you didn't seen something like that.
You're holbeds to the horizont that's in millions of millions of away, and all you see, often and book.
I've been there's not a lot with Miguel.
He's an unapproach, three parts Charles Darwin and part of the Darwin Crocodile.
All right? Here's there beyond hard, begin, and I mean, I'm lucky, and I've forward, and Miguel's coming out of biology.
Here he's showing a wall of the black.
It's now mention of fitoplankton.
And here he sees a pattern of groups in groups who remember the grafy.
We found that Miguel has spent most of the career in the Mikumi National Mikumi in National Mikumi in Africa.
We asked them how to become an expert like an expert in fish.
He said, "Well, I don't know anything about fish.
I'm an expert in relationships. "
And then it's launching more discusions about rare and algae and algae plants.
And I don't get me wrong, it was really fascinating, you know, a kind of biotic community in directly.
It's been great, but I've been gone.
And I was launched after that piece of delicious fish, find too long, which I consumed in the precedented night.
So I ask it. I said, "Miguel," Miguel, what your fish? "
He showed to the algae.
"Yes, I know, filfizonule, the fitoplankton, relationships, it's amazing.
But what your fish?
What is the rate of food? "
Well, he started telling me that it's a rich system like, that the fish, which is eating and in the wild.
Biomasa plankton, the fitoplankton, the zoplankton, this fish feeds.
The system is so healthy, it's completely renote.
It's not another food.
Do you've ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed their animals?
Later that day, I would drive this car by Miguel, and I said, "For a place that looks like," For a place that seems like, "Whatever you've got to success?"
At that point, it was like the regizer of a film would have to change the decorrate.
And I gave the corner and saw the most astonishes, thousands and thousands of flamingo, thousands and I've seeing the eyes.
"This is success," hope.
"Look at their rock.
They're walking. "
I was completely unless.
I said, "Miguel, but they don't fish from your fish?"
"Yes," he said.
"We're about 20 percent of our fish and fish process because of the forest.
Well, last year, this property property of 600,000 birds on it, more than 250 different species.
Today's became the bigger and one of the most important sanctures of Europe. "
I said, "Miguel," Miguel, "Miguel,"
He clined his head, not.
He said, "We grow fish extension, not intensive.
This is an ecological network.
The flamingo flamingo eats.
Stars are eating fitoplankton.
So, the more rock is, the bigger the system. "
All right, recapitule.
A farm that doesn't feeds of animals, and it's a farm that they measure their success.
A fish, but it's a fish, but a sanctuar.
Oh, by the way, those flamingo, they should not be there.
They're in a city at 240 kilometers, where the conditions are better to build their bodies.
In every morning, 240 kilometer to farm.
And every night, they fly 240 kilometers back.
They're doing this because they're able to track the white line of A92 A92.
It's not a joke.
I imagine something like penguines, so I've looked at Miguel.
I said, "Miguel, they fly 240 kilometers at the farm, and then 240 kilometers back to night?
Do they do this for their pus? "
He looked at myself as I'd be quote from a Whitney Houston.
He said, "No. I do it because food is better."
I didn't mentioned my fish skin skin, which was delicious, and I didn't like fish.
I don't like it. I don't like.
It's got that gust, like goon.
When I cook, I'm a part of the time.
However, when I gusted it to that restaurant in the southern of Span, it was not at all of the fish pies.
He's a sweet and clean like you've got a ocean of the ocean.
I mentioned this of Miguel's been doing.
He said, "She acts like a bures.
It's the last appear in the way it goes into the body.
He's evolved to absorb impurity. "
And then he added, "But our water has no impurity."
All right. It's a fish who don't feed their fish.
A farm who measure success through the success of their own animal success.
And then I understood when he said, a farm that doesn't have impurity, he's super-valued farm from the Guadalquivir.
It's a river that brings all of the things that they tend to bring into the days, to bring these days, chemical impurities.
And when it's doing its way through the system, and it's flower than the entry.
The system is so healthy that speech water.
So, not only a farm that doesn't feeds of animals, not just a farm that measure their success by the health success of their own animals, but a farm that's quite a fish of watch, and not only for those fish, but it also for me.
Because when the water raising, it's going to be in the Atlantic Ocean.
A painting in the ocean, I know, but they're consider, but you should do it, because this love story, because this love story, although it's also instructive.
You may say it's a network for the future of good food, whether we're talking or vitself.
What we need now is a new radical concept of agriculture, one where food actually has gust good.
But for a lot of people that's a little bit too radical.
We're not realistic.
We're deeply.
We love markets.
We love little family farms.
We're talking about local food food.
We eate organic.
And when you sugggesting that these are things that will ensure the future of good food, somewhere raising the future up and says, "Hey, and I love the flamingo, but how will you feed the world?
How will you feed the world? "
Can I be honest?
I don't like that question.
No, because we're already produce more calories than it's needed for the world.
A billion of people will be flass today.
A billion -- that's more than ever before -- because of the great inequalities in distribution not because of the amount.
Now, I don't like this question because he determined the logic of our last 50 years.
She's snails, free monocultures of pesticides, chemicals in the soil, gives you to fish, and all the business business, "How bad can we feed more of people with less fish?"
This was the motivation.
It was justify.
It's been the plan agricultural business.
We're supposed to say name, a business, a business, a business that erodes quickly making that possible production.
That's not a business, and it's not agriculture.
Our couple of bread is today's threatened today, but it's because of the resource of the resources, not the inventing of the last tractor combine, but it's the lacids of farms, not the farms, but it's gone, not faster lacks. It '
You want to feed the world?
Let's asking question: How are we going to feed ourselves?
Or better, how can we create the conditions that allow every communities to feed themselves?
To do that, you don't look at the business model business model business in the future.
It's very old. It's very old.
They have a lot of capital, chemistry and machines, and it didn't ever produced something good by food.
Instead of this, to look at the ecological model.
This is the one that is based on billion years of experience to work.
Look at Miguel, farmers like Miguel, farms like Miguel, who's not just for those farming, ffarms that are not only makers, but expertise in relationship, farmers that are not only producers, but experts in relationship, they's intensive.
And if I want to be indeed to be better than I'm going to be better than I'll ever be me.
You know, I care about this, because if this is the future of the good food, it's going to be delicious.
Thank you.
I grew up with a constant Science Fiction.
At high school, I was going to school a hhan hour bus an hour, and one hour every day.
And I was always absorry of a book, a scientific book, which is my mind to my mind to other world and satisfying my mind to other world and satisfy satisfy, which I had.
And, you know -- that curiosity is manifestate that, whenever I wasn't at school, I was outside, and I'm growing and samples, "samples, brogggames, and I'd froggggames, and I'd like it.
I was a whole true in science.
But everything had connected to understand the world, to understand the world, to understand the limitations of the possible.
And my passion for scientific scientific passion really seems to be found in the world around me, because of what's happening, because of what's happening -- that's going on at the end of the ocean.
Jacques Coustwere coming up with the amazing of the amazing special emission that showed our animals and places in a fantastic world that we could not have to imagine before.
So, this seemed to be resonate with the whole scientific part of science.
And I was an artist.
We could paint. We could paint.
And I discovered that, because there were no video games and respective to this CG and all this saturation of CG and all this full of images in my head, I had to create these images in my head.
You all, you know, as kids need to read a book, and through the descriptions of the authors, to put something on the cinematographic screene of our heads.
And so, my answer to all of this was drawing, to paint creatures and the world extratever, robots, spaces, all of these things.
I was always caught to the city of mathematical mathematical.
That's what happens because this creativity needed to find, a way of range.
And there's an interesting thing, Jacques Coustered has made me very excited about the fact that there's a foreign world, extrate, right here on Earth.
I couldn't really go into a spacal world, in a spacal born, in the space.
This dream pretty unrealist.
But that was a world in which we could really go, and this was just like, on Earth, and this was just as rich and exotic like whatever I've imagined those books.
So I decided I'm going to become a dive at the age of 15 years.
And the only problem with this was that I've lived in a little bit of Canada, to 600 miles away from the ocean.
But I didn't leaved this.
I took my dad until he finally found, until he finally, a classroom in Buffalo, New York, exactly, to where we live.
And I've actually become a dive in a pison in YMCA in the middle of the western in Buffalo, New York.
And I've never seen the ocean, a true ocean for two years, when we moved in California.
Since then, about 40 years, we've spent about 3,000 hours under the water and 500 of those hours were in the submarine.
And I've learned that the deeply of the ocean, and even less oceans less deep, I'm so full of life, it's really beyond what we can imagine.
The nature of nature is so missed by limits, in comparishes, in our comparison.
I'm completely amazing yet of what I see when they do these dives.
And my story story with the ocean ocean ocean ocer, and it's as strong as it was always.
But when I chose a career, like adult, that's adult, that's been.
And that seemed to be the best way to contain this need that I had to tell stories with the need to create images.
And, in childhood, I've drawings, and so on.
So, creating films was the way to put the images and stories together. And this has had sense.
And of course, the stories I chose to tell you were incidental scientific stories, "Aliener," Aliens "and" Aliens "and" Aliens "."
And with "Abish", "I've got my love for the underwater landscape and diving with films.
Combining these two passions.
Something interesting happened in "Abish", "which is solving a specific narative problem, which is the creation of this lichide in the water, which is what we've remained animation of calculator, CG.
And that's led to the first characross a film.
And even though the film didn't done money, I've been marter to something extraordinary, which is that audience, the global audience, was hypness hypnotes of this magical appearance.
You know, it's the law of Arthur Clarke that any advanced technology is impossible distinished by magic.
They saw something magic.
And so, that made me become very excited.
And I thought, "Wow," Wow, that's adoptical art. "
That's why, "Terminator 2," which was my next film, I've got this far more far.
Lucter with ILM, we created on the individual metal metal in that movie, success of how the movie was going to work.
And it worked. And we created it.
And we had the same result with the audience.
We've done something more money on this.
So, living a line between these two experiences, has result in the fact that this will be a completely new form of creativity for artists artists.
In conclusion, I put the basis of a companies with Stan Winston, which is the creatures of creatures and costumes at that time, and I called Domain.
And the idea behind the company was that we're going to shared the analogical process and so forth and we're going to go into digital production.
And we've actually done this, what gave us a competitive advantage for a while.
But we've remained in the '90s in terms of the design of creatures and the characters of creature and characters, for the company had been funded.
And we wrote this piece called "Avatar," which has had the role of being able to pushing things more like the visual effects of calculator and more, with human characters of computer emotions, generated in CG.
And the main character would be with completely generated in CG.
And the world would be all of CG.
But the plans didn't go.
And people from my company told me that we can't do that for a while.
So we put the idea of forest, and we've done another film about a large boat that's diving.
You know, I went and presented it to study like "Romeo and Julieta."
He was going to be a romantic story, a passional proportions, a passional film.
In secretly, what I wanted to do was to do was to get me to research of Titanic.
And that's why we've done.
This is the truth. Well, studio doesn't know that.
But we convinced them. I said, "We're going to movie. We're going to film. We're going to film good.
We're going to use this at the beginning of the film.
It'll be very important. It's going to be an excellent to marketing. "
And I convinced it to funding an expedition.
It's crazy. But it's got to the subject that your imagination can create a reality.
Because we've actually created a reality where six months later, I find myself in a couple of miles and a half miles under North Atlantic, looking at the truth of the Titanic Atlantic, not a film in a film, no HD, not at a film, not a film HD.
Now, that fascinated me.
And it's needed a lot of prepared, we have to build cameras and all kinds of stuff, and all kinds of things like this, but it's deep like this deep-like deep mission of a space mission.
You know, where everything was strong technologized, which is a lot of planning, which is really a lot of planning.
You're in this capsule, you're going to this dark and style where there's no hope to be saved if you can't go back.
And I thought, "Wow Parlive in a scientific film.
That's really cool. "
And so I've been truly caught of the ocean exploration.
Of course, curiosity, of the scientific aspect.
It's all. It was curiosity. It was curiosity. It was imagination.
And it was an experience that Hollywood can't offered me.
Because, you know, I could imagine a creature, and I could create a visual effect for it. But I couldn't imagine what I was seeing through that huge.
While I'd done a few of the expeditions of hydrothermal and sometimes things I've never seen before, sometimes that nobody had never seen bebefore, who were not described by science at the time, and we've all seen the photo.
So, we were completely cucked by this, and I had to have to have more.
So we made a pretty much curious decision.
After the success of Titanic, I said, "I'm going to put a mession of my hollywood-ian of films, and it's becoming a while."
And so we began to do these expeditions.
And we've got to go to Bismark and explore it with the help of robotic vehicles.
We went back to Titanic.
We've taken little robots I'd created in the optical fiber.
And the idea was to go inside and to make a interior exploration of the inner exploration, which didn't have done.
Nobody's watched inside. They didn't have the middle of doing this, so we've created technology to achieve this.
So, you know, here's the answer of Titanic, in a submarine and looking at the podes that were showing a lot like the ones I knew that I knew was played orchestra.
And I control a small vehicle of robotic vehicle by the cycle.
When I say, I control it, but my mind is in that vehicle.
And I felt like I was physically presented the inside of Titanic.
And it's been the most common from common experience I ever had, because I knew before, because I knew before the lights of the vehicle, because I knew before the lights of the vehicle to revehicle it, because I knew months when I create the film.
And the scene was built like an exact replies of the vapor.
This was an absolutely remarkable experience.
And he made me realize really the telepresenting the telepresent that you can have with these robotic Earth, when your consciousness is injected in a vehicle, in this other form of existence.
It was a profoundly thing.
And perhaps a quick of what could happen in a couple of decades, as we're going to begin to have a cyborg to explore or for other scores in many of the types of post-human fan.
So, making these expeditions and began to appreciate really what I discovered there, down, like these areas of income areas of the oceans of the ocean, where we discovered these amazing animals.
They're in essentially extra who live right here on Earth.
They live in a chemical synthetic synthesis not survive in a solar-based system, like us.
And you see animals that live in water with 500 degrees with 500 degrees.
You think it could not survive you could not survive.
At the same time, I became very interested in the space, again, the science of the space that I've experienced in my childhood.
And I woke up involved in the community of the space, very involved with the NASA consultancy consultant with the NASA consultancy, going into Russian, go into Russian, it's when they've gone through the roomedical challenges of these.
And that was fascinating.
But what I've got to do is to bring people to the space with us in deep.
And that's driving for them to have access, astrobiologists, the planetary of planetary environments, people who were interested in these extreme environments, and so on.
So here's making our documentary movies, but we're actually studied, we created the space science.
We've finished completely the circle of the scientific, you know, as a kid, you know, as a child, and it's doing good. You know, I learned a lot.
I've learned a lot about science. But we've also learned a lot about the art to drive.
Now, you've got to believe that the regular has to be a leader, leader, and all of these things.
I didn't really learned about the art to do these expeditions until we've done these expeditions.
Because I had, at a moment, to say, "What do here?
Why do I do that? What do I won this? "
We don't make money with these missions.
We're able to survive. I don't like any famous famous famous.
People about that I went between "Titanic" and "Titanic" and "Avatar."
We've done all these films for a very limited audience for a very limited audience.
Without famous, no money. What do you do?
You're doing it for challenge, for challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenge of discovery and for the connection of discovery and for the connection of the requires that forms when a small group.
Because we were doing these things with a 10-12 team people, working years.
Sometimes [being] to three months.
And in this connection, you realize that the most important thing is the breathing you've got for them and they have for you, that you've done a job you can't.
When you go back to the countries and you say, "We have to do this, and fibra fiber of optical, and that's what's been involved, and it's what it was involved, and it can't figure out people that they can't know that they can do it. It"
It makes a connection, creates a respect of respect.
So, when I went back to my film, which was "Avatar," I tried to apply the same principle to drive the same principle of driving, which is to respect your team, and that's respective and their breathing.
And it really changed the dynamic.
Here's where I've got a small team, unknown technology, making "invatar," inventing new technology, which was not until then.
Extraordinarily interesting.
Extraordinary challenge.
And I've become a family, on a four years, and a half years and a half.
And this changed with all the way of my films.
So people committed the way that, well, you know, you've got, you know, you've got, you know, you've address on the planet.
For I was more a fundamental way to make business, the process itself, which has changed as a result of this.
So, what can we synthesis of this?
You know, what are the lessons are learned?
Well, I think the first is curiosity.
It's the strongest thing you have.
Imagine is a force that's a force that's really manifesta reality.
And the reject of your team is more important than everybody in the world.
Tinks of films creators come to me and say, "Let me a shape to do this."
And I say, "Don't limited you.
Other people will do that for you, not do it alone, it doesn't make it alone.
And look at risk. "
NASA has this froza: "The Emachine is not an option option."
But the failure needs to be an art in art and exploration, because it's a stuff.
And there's no innovation that has asked innovation.
You have to be willing to take those risks.
So, that's the thinking with you, which is that in whatever you do, the ESTE's a option, but not thank you.
I'll leave you with a single important idea today, which is that the entire amount of data that we consume is bigger than sume of parts, and, instead of thinking about how we can use information to look at the way that we can use the patterns that we can use them to see the patterns, and we can see them to see the patterns.
We're now looking at an average of mortality organized after the age of the age.
The program that they use here is experimental, is called Pivot, and what I can do with it is that I can do with him is that they can move a certain causes, accidence for example.
Here's a different structure, and there's a different structure.
That's because, here in the middle, people are in their period, and this is because they're becoming very fragile.
We're doing a step back and arrange the data after death, we're seeing that circulators and cancer are suspects, but not for everybody.
If we continue and filter after the age, we're doing 40 years old or less, we see that accidents are actually causes the most frequency to worry people.
And further, it's especially for men.
You understand that this visualization of data, it's like the data, it's like you've got in a flip of information.
And if we can do that with simple data, why don't we do the same with content?
Here's where we've got the cover of Sports Ilustrated that far before.
They're all on the Internet. They're all on the Internet.
You can try this house when you go home in here.
With Pivot, you're going to figure.
And then some years.
You can go directly to a certain subject.
I'm looking at this -- I see the atleons that emerged in this sport.
I'm a big fan Lance Armstrong, so I'm going to me, and that's where LArmstrong.
If I just want to look at it, maybe I'm just going through "What would have to see what about cycle in general?"
I go back and open this.
I see Greg Lemond Lemond now.
And you understand that when you're navigate through this way, when you're specific, when you're more generally, you don't find it.
You get something different.
It's somewhere in the middle, and we think it changes the way it can be used.
I want to go a little bit further on this idea that's a little bit more on this idea.
We took every page in Wikipedia, and I've done it to a resume.
The short is just a short description and an iconial description of the field in which comes from.
I'll just show you the first 500 of pages right here.
But even in this limited view, we can do a lot of things.
We're seeing the main of the most population on Wikipedia.
Now I'm going to select government.
Now I've now chose government, I can see the category of Wikipedia that corresponds the most frequently, and this is the Time -- Personality.
And that's important because it's a thing that wasn't content in any Wikipedia.
You can discover this thing just if you make a step back and look at all simultaneously.
As all of these particular particular, I can then explore more atent the concepty of Time -- Personality of the Eversonality, to bring them all of them to the surface.
And I'm looking at these people, I see that most of the government.
A few come from natural science.
A few, and less come from business.
Here's my head.
And this comes from music.
And quite interesting, Bono is and a winner of TED.
So we're going to look at the winners of TED.
You see, we're navigate for the first time like a network, and it's not from pages, but in a higher level of abstraction.
And I'm going to show you one thing to take you by surprise.
I'll show you New York Times.
Our application -- we don't want to call it browser, because it's not quite a browser, but you can see the web pages with it -- and we use technology, and we're going to see the web page.
I can make a step back, I'll go back to a certain section.
Why's it's really important because by access web pages in this way, I can see my entirely same way.
I can explore in detail that we've done in different periods.
Here's the situation of this demo that we now.
And I can look at the stuff that I've done today.
And if I'm going to do a step back and I'm looking at the history of search, for example.
Here I've been looking for Bing, here for Live Live ve Live ve Live ve Live Labs.
And here I can choose a page, and to lay it again.
It's a metaphor is a lot of times, and in every case it's bigger than the sum of the parts of data.
Now, in our world, we believe that data is a blestestern for us.
We're cry of the glog of the surface with information.
We're saying that we're in data.
What if we've turned everything inverse, and we've turn out and the webse, so instead to the next, and so instead of things, and we're able to get from more things, and to be able to find out of many more things, and to be able?
If we do that, instead of being caught in the data, we could actually extract information.
And instead of we're only getting a relationship with information, we could actually extract knowledge.
And if we're knowledge, maybe it's also to find.
This, thank you.
Everybody talks about happiness today.
I asked somebody to numbers who have the word "happiness" in the headline were published over the past five years, and it took about 40. They're much more.
There's a high-interest for happiness researchers.
There's a lot of consiliation for happiness.
Everybody wants to make people happier.
But despite the number of activities in this field, there's a few cognitive captures that we're clear to make a clear image about happiness.
My presentation today is going to make reference in these cognitive captures.
They're valuable to people who are thinking about happiness, how they're researchers who are studying the happiness of happiness, it turns out that we're as confused as everybody else else.
The first one of these capcans is the reticence to admit the complexity of happiness.
It looks like the term "happiness," It's not a word useful because we use it too many different things.
We've probably there's a specific sense that we're going to take it, but we're going to take this notion and take a better vision of well-being.
The second capcane is a confusion between memory and memory: in fact, a confusion between being happy in life, and it's a confuse of your life.
They're two very different concepts, very different concepts, in the notion of happiness.
And the third confusion is the illusion of perception, the regretable that we can't think about any circumstances that affect our importance.
And this is a serious cognitive.
It's just don't perceive it.
I'd like to start with the example of a person in time of a session and answers to the end of a questions and answers to the end of a set of my storytelling a happen.
He said that listen to a symphony, and that music was absolutely wonderful.
But at the end of the recording, was heard a terrified terrible and added, pretty affected, and enough, quite affected the whole experience.
It's actually didn't experience, it's memory.
Like his experience.
Tried 20 minutes of wonderful music.
But there were to zero, because what's remained was the memory.
Rememember was altered, and remember was all what's happened.
The conclusion here is that we're probably perhaps we're probably wish.
There's a self in real moment, which remainly in the present, and it's living the past, but essentially has just the present.
It's the synbobobook to the doctor.
You know, when the doctor, "Do you appear here?"
On the other hand there's the syns of memory, and the entire memory of our life.
That's what's addressed the doctor when you ask, "How would you have you the last time?"
or "How was the excourse in Albania?"
That's two are very different entities, the moment and the syns of the memory, and the confusion of happiness.
Their memory is a storyteller.
It's starting with the basic answer of our memories, starts imedied.
We don't tell stories when we have consciousness stories.
Our myself is telling us, more precisely, what we're going to retain in our lives is a story.
Let me start with an example.
There's an old study about patients that go through an experience.
I don't inside the detail. It's not painful today, but it was painful during the '90.
The patients was asked to describes to their pain every 60 sec.
We've got two of their relationship.
The question is, "Who has suffered more?"
It's a very simple question.
Obviously, the B has suffered more.
His colonoscopy took more, he's gone through every minute of pain which he's patient.
But here's another question, "How did these these patients suffering"? "
And there's a surprise: Surprising is that the patient A is that the patient.
The Memories of these colonoscopes have been different because a crucial part of the story is how they end.
None of the relationships is not memorable or free of one of them -- but one of them is obviously unplenty than the other.
And the unplug was that it was more intended to the end.
It's an unplant story.
Where do we know?
We asked these people after the colonoscopy, much later, much later, much later, how crowing was the procedure.
In their memory, it's been much more unplant for the patient A than B.
It's a directly conflict, between the moment and times of memory.
And from the point of view of the experimental synels, it's clear that the B has suffered more.
Which we could do with the patient A, and we actually did clinical experiments, which have worked, we've been colonoscopy of the patient of the patient's going to move it too much.
That's going to make a suffer, but a little bit less than before.
If we're doing it for a couple of minutes of the patient's experience of the patient A, but we've left the patient with a better memory of its experience.
What is define a story?
And it's the stories that you don't stories that we're inventing.
Which is define a story is the changes, the moments and the end.
The end is very, very, very important.
In this case, the end was the hotter.
The moments of living is life continuous.
Do you have successive moments of living, and you questions: What happens with these moments?
And the answer is very simple.
They're losing for always.
Most of the time of life -- and I calculated: psychological present: psychological present, it's like that they're taking about three seconds.
That's where we have about 600 million of these moments.
We have about 600,000.
Most no way.
Most of them are completely ignore of memory.
And yet, we're going to have the impression that what's happening in these moments of living lives.
It's the finite resource we consume during our existence on the ground.
And the way we spend it should be relevant, but that's not the story that syns of memory is the story that they're seeing.
So we've got the size of the moment, which are distinct.
The biggest difference between them is the way it's time.
In the point of view of the moment, if you leave the vacation and second week is just as good as the first, the vacance, it's about two weeks.
And for the memory of the memory, things don't work at all like this.
To memory, a vacation of two-weeks is nesessentially better than a vacation of a week, because it doesn't bring new memories.
The story was not changed.
So the time becomes the essential variable to the distinguisential variable to the moment.
The story has a reduced impact on the story.
The memory of the memory is not only to remembered their stories.
It's actually the one that decisions, because, if a patient has had, for example, two different colonoschildren with two different churges with two different different and decisions and decisions it's going to be the one of the job that choice.
The experimentally doesn't have nothing to say in this choice.
We don't actually choose between experiences, but between experiences.
And even when we think about the future, we don't think about the future as a set of experiences.
We're thinking about our future, like some anticipated memories.
And in essentially you can consider this, as a tiranion of memory, and you can consider the synelse of memory, and you can consider the synals as the experiences that experiment doesn't need.
We feel that when we go to vacation, and that's happening very often, which is happening very often, we're going on in vacation, in the service of your memory.
And that's kind of justified, it seems.
I mean, what do we measure our memories?
This is one of the things that's domination of the time.
And when I think about this, I'm thinking about a vacation I spent in Antarctica a couple years ago, which was clear the best vacation I've had, and I'm thinking about other vacation.
And I've probably consumed the memories of that vacance of three weeks to say for about 25 minutes in the last four years.
If I'd be opened albump with the 600 pictures, I'd have spent one hour.
So, we have a hand, three weeks and a half a hour, one hour and a half an hour and a half.
It seems like a discrepancy.
I may be a little bit of extremely through the noise that I'm consumption that I'm consumption, but even if you're consuming them into a bigger measure.
Why do we agree so much important memory by compared to experience?
So, I'd like to think about a thinking experiment.
Imagine that at your next vacation, you know that at the end of the vacation, you know that at the end of the vacation of all your picture so that you can take a drug that is going to take a drug that you don't remember anything anything.
Do you choose the same vacation?
And if you're choosing another vacation, there's a conflict between the experiment and you have to think about how to transible this conflict, and it's actually not at all because if you take the time like criterious, you'll have a answer.
And if you take memories like criterious, you could have another answer.
Why do we choose?
It's a problem where we're confront of the experiment and the one of memory.
The experimentally and their memories reference to two different notions of happiness.
There's actually two of happiness concepts that we can apply, one for each self.
So you can ask: How happy is the experiment?
And on the other hand: How happy are the moments in life of synelse?
And they're all happiness.
It's a pretty complicated process.
What are the emotions that can be measured?
And by the way, now we're in measure we're in measure of the experimental happiness of time.
Instead, happiness, is a completely different thing.
It's not about how happy lives his life.
It's about how satisfied is this person when it's thinking about his life.
It's a very different notion.
Who doesn't do the distinction between these notions, it will compromise the study of happiness, and I'm getting a group of researchers that compromised happiness to happiness the study of happiness.
The distinction between happiness synelse and the satisfaction was recognized over the past years, and they're doing now, and they're doing the separate.
The Gallup the Gallup makes a global level where better than half-million people have been asked what about their life and experiences.
And they've been made other similar efforts.
So in the past years, we began to learn some things about the two of happiness.
And I think the main lessons I learned, is that they're learning, is that they're really different.
You can know how satisfied are some of their life, and this isn't really indicate long about how happy they are in their life, and green.
Just to give you an example of corelationship, corelationship is about 0.5? That means that if you're talking to someone, "Oh," His, "Oh," How do you have a lot of standing about the intimate.
Well, you've got something about his inaltimate, but there's a lot of certainty.
If you're saying that someone evaluated life to eight on a scale of tension, you've got a lot of happiness about who's in the experiment.
So correlationship is small.
We know something about what's controlling the satisfaction of happiness.
We know that money are very important.
We know that happiness is that happiness is to be satisfy with the people who like, we're going to spend with people who like.
There's other bodies, they're dominant.
So if you want to maximize happiness, you'll get happiness different things.
The conclusion to what we've said, is the fatp that we don't have to go about happiness as a good substitute.
It's a completely different notion.
Now, very quickly, another reason why we can't simplistic about happiness is that we don't feel about happiness and whether we're going on to the same stuff that we don't think about life and when we're effective.
So if you ask a simple question about how happy people in California are not going to get the right answer.
And when you put this question, you have to be more happy in California if, for example, you're in California.
And what's happening is that when you think about the trade in California, you're thinking about the contrast is, like this contrast is, for example, climate.
It turns out that climate isn't really important for the experimantly, and it's not very important for the reflective synons that decides how happy people are.
But, because of the fact that reflectively is at leadership, you could get -- some people could move in California.
And it's quite interesting to watch what's going to be more happen to California hope that they will be happier.
So they're experimental is not becoming happier.
We know that.
But one thing will happen. They'll think they're happier.
because, when they're going to do to this, and they'll remembered as the time in Ohio. And they'll feel good decision.
It's very difficult to think about well-being, and I hope I've offered a picture of how difficult is.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have a question for you.
Thank you very much.
A few weeks ago, when I talked to the phone, you've got an interesting result in the Gallup.
Do you think that you can share this given that you have a few minutes?
Daniel Kahneman: Sure.
I think the most interesting result of the Gallup is a number that we didn't expect that we've never expected place to get.
What we found is in happiness to happiness in happiness.
We looked at how the feelings working on income function.
and it seems like a 60,000 dollars a year, for American, and this is a big number of American, and this is a big number of American, about 600,000 what's a big representative, under a 600,000 dollars a year --
CA: 60,000.
DK: 60,000 dollars a year, people are unhappy, and they're getting more unfortunately as they're getting more unfortunate line.
I'm going to say I've also seen line.
It's clear that money don't bringing to their experimentally, but we can measure this very, very exactly exactly.
In terms of the other self, the memory is, we've got to do with another situation.
The more you're more money with that you're satisfy.
This is not true in the case of emotions.
CA: But Danny, the American's dream is about liberty, freedom.
If the world would take this serious discovery, serious, I want to say, everything we think, for example, politics fiscal and so on.
Is there any political chance of humans, like the state state, to take a constatement and release political in the public field in the public field political field in the public field of the audience on it?
DK: You know, I think there's a recognize of happiness in public politics.
The recognize will be lense in the US, undoubt, but in the UK, it happens, and in other countries happen.
People figure out the fact that it should be thinking about happiness when they think about public politics.
He's going to take a while, and the world will be going to study happiness, or whether they want to study happiness, and so we need to have this quite soon, so we have to have this quite soon, so we think about whether we're thinking about whether we're thinking about whether we '
This is going to influence politics, I think, in the next years.
In the US, it's in the US, the experimental of the population of this will constitute, I think, in the next or two decades, a part of the national statistics, or part of the national statistics, or at least the largest interested in in the greatest politics of the most interesting.
I thank you so much because you have invented behavioral economy.
Thank you Danny Kahneman.
I'm going to talk about energy and climate.
And that may seem a little bit of surprisingly because my work with the entire norm of vaccines and seeds, and it's, and it's what we're needed to help the poor of two billion lives.
But energy and climate are extremely important for these people, even more important than anybody else on the planet.
The climate of climate is that a lot of years, their crops are not going to grow.
It's going to be too much rain, it's not going to be enough.
Things are going to change in ways that their fragile environment.
And this leads to the foametes. It's nesigurance. It's about nelines.
climate change.
And also, the price of energy is very important for them.
In fact, if we could choose a single thing that we could choose the price to reduce the price to reduce poverty, we've far on the energy.
Well, the price of energy was reduced in time.
Even so, the advanced civilization is based on energetic progress.
The coal revolution food revolution and even in the 1990s industrial revolution and even in the 1990s price, and that's why we've got fast, we can create the modern material and makes so much things.
And so we're in a wonderful situation about electricity in the rich world.
But once we're doing it more cheaper -- and we're going to do it for two times cheaper -- we need to breathing a new building with CO2.
CO2 is warming the planet, and look at CO2 is very simple.
If we add the amount of CO2 emise, this leads to a temperature of temperature, and growth of temperature, and growing temperature effects.
The effects on the time, and maybe it's in the indirect effecosystems that natural ecosystems can't adapt these fast changes, and that's the collapse.
Well, measure exact of corelationship between CO2 and growth of the temperature, and where there's the growth of positive, but not very big.
And there's certaintitude certainty about how groups are going to be extremely group.
We asked the great scientists, in repeately, we really need to get close to zero?
We can't reduce to half or a quarter?
And the answer is, until we're not going to zero, the temperature will continue to grow.
So we have a big problem.
It's not alone with a high room that we need to go on under a three feet, and it may be able to buy.
Here's where we need to zero.
They're emitting a lot of carbon dioxide in every year, over 26 billion tons.
For every American is about 20 tons.
For people of pooace is less than a ton.
In the average at the level of the planet is about five tons for every human.
And somehow, we've got to do this to zero.
He grew constantly.
It's only different economic changes a kind of stabilization, so we need to go from a quickly growth, and so we need to zero.
Ecuation has four factors.
It's a power.
So, we've got something on the left, CO2, which we want to be to zero, and that's based on the number of people are using environment, for every person and the CO2 emal emis on the average of energy.
Let's look at each of them and see how we can get to zero.
Probably one of these numbers will have to be close to zero.
Now, that's from high school high school, but let's a look.
First we have the population.
They have 6.8 billion people.
It's going to be about nine billion.
Now, if we do a great job with new vaccess with new vaccines, medical services and reproductive health, but here we're seeing this with 10 or 15 percent, but here we see a growth of about 1.3.
The second factor is the services we use.
That includes everything, food we eat, food we eat, television.
That's very good stuff, and of poverty means of poverty is to provide these services of work on the planet.
And it's a great thing like this to grow.
In the rich world, maybe in the first billions, probably billions, but every year, in every year, but every year, this flies, average, average, it's going to grow, so in general, the services are going to ground up two.
Here's a very elementary service.
Do you have light in the home to be able to be able?
Well, these kids didn't, so they're going to read their temes to light bulb.
Then efficiency, it's energy for every service, here we've got something good news.
We have something that doesn't grow.
By different inventions and ways of illuminventions, through different kinds of car, different ways to build build buildings, there's a lot of services where you can reduce energy for that quite substantial services, even with 90 percent.
There's other services, like we're born or how we're doing transportation, where it's much less place for improvement.
So, average, if we're optimistic, we could get a three to reduction, maybe six times.
But for these three factors until now, we get from 26 billion from, in the best case, maybe 13 billion tons, and that's not enough.
So let's look at the fourth factor -- that's going to be a key factor -- which is the amount of CO2 on the energy unit.
And the question is, can we do it to zero?
If coal, coal, not.
If you look at natural gas, not.
Almost every way to produce electricity today, the exception of the renewables and emerging, emana CO2.
What we're going to have to make global scale, is to create a new system.
So, we need miracles of energy.
Now, when I use miracle, I don't mean something that is impossible.
Microprocessor is a miracle. Calculator is a miracle.
The Internet and services are a miracle.
People here have contributed to create many miracles.
We're normally not have a term, to get a miracle until a miracle to a particular.
It's just expect and some of the wine, some of the wine.
This is a case where we actually need to accelerate about maximum and get a miracle of a quite quite short interval.
I've thought: How could I figure out?
Is there any natural illustration, a demonstration that could stimulate people?
I thought this year, I've been brought to the mosquito, and it looks like.
He actually involved in the idea that, you know, there are people who live with the mosquito.
Now, with energy, everything I could find was this.
And I thought I'd thought I've gone to be my contribution to the environment here in this year.
So there's some natural lics.
I was told that he didn't. It could not not have a music.
Now, there's all kinds of solutions, like this, but they don't know what value.
We need solutions, one or more, which have an incredible scale, and they're very incredible, and they're seeing in many directions, I see only five that I can produce big numbers.
We've left far energy, geotermic, the fuel, bioterms.
They could contribute to contribute, and whether they're going to ask me what expectations, the better.
But what I want to point here is that we're going to work on each of these five, and that we can't get any of them even if they seem coast, because they're all seeing significant, because they're all seeing difive.
Let's look at the fossil fuels, whether it's the coal gas.
What we need to be done here, but it's not, but it's not, we're going to take the COs, after it, we're going to put it somewhere and hope it's in there.
Now we have some pilot of the pilot of 60 percent to 80 percent, but it's going to 80 percent, but it's going to be very difficult, and it's going to be hard to understand where to the amount of CO2, but here 'the greatest problem is the longest problem.
Who is going to be sure?
Who's going to guaranter something that's letters of billions of times that you can think, nuclear or other?
It's a very big volume.
It's a hard problem.
The next would be nuclear energy.
It's also got three big issues.
The cost, especially in strict countries, it's big.
The problem of surances, to be line that nothing can happen, that's although they're not going to be used for weapons.
And then what do with residues?
And even though there's not so many, there's a lot, it's a lot, it's even though there's no many, it's even though there's not so many, it's even though there's not so much, we're not so much.
People need to feel good about this.
So there's three very hard issues that could have to work on them.
The last three of the five we put together together.
These are the ones that the world called renewable.
But they -- even if it's wonderful that they didn't need fuel -- some disadvantage.
One is that the density of the energy of these technologies is much smaller than an electric center.
These are a lot of energy, we're talking here a lot of square kilometers, a surface of thousands of times bigger than a normal power.
All of these are intermitant sources.
The sun doesn't happen all day, and it doesn't streets every day, and it doesn't have all the time.
If we're depending on these sources, we need a way to get energy in those periods when it's not available.
Here's got big problems.
We have difficulty with transportation.
For example, say that a source of energy source is outside of the country, you don't need technology, you have to exposure to each other.
And finally, there's the problem.
And in order to understand the size, we took all of the batteries that are produced, for machines, computers, whatever.
We compared to the amount of energy that world consume the world, and we discovered that all of the batteries we could now store than 10 minutes in the energy.
So, in fact, we need a significant progress here, a solution of a hundred times than what we have now.
It's not impossible, but it's not easy.
The problem of this appearance when we want intermitent source to be over, say, 20, 30 percent of the consumption.
If we based on it for 100 percent, we need a miracle battery.
Now, how are we going to go further, what's the right road?
It's a Manhattan Project? What can we get there?
Well, we need a lot of competition to work on this, hundreds.
On one of these roads, we need at least 100 people.
And in many of them, and you'll say that they're crazy. That's good. That's good.
I think here in the group of TED, we have a lot of people who are already on this road.
Bill Gross has a few companies, between which one called Solar, which has some excellent solar technologies.
Vinod Khosla investing in companies that make remarkable things and have interesting things, and have interesting possibilities, and I'm trying to support it.
Nathan Myhrvold and I actually have a company that, maybe in surprisingly, it's going on.
There's some innovations in nuclear, there's some innovation.
But innovation actually stopped in this field long, so I'd be surprisingly surprisingly there were good ideas on somewhere.
The TerraPower is that, instead of burning a part of the uranium, that one percent that's U235, we decided to show the 99 percent of the U238.
It's a kind of crazy idea.
In fact, it's been talking about it for a long time, but it's never able to work or not.
It's only because of modern supercomputer supercomputers now can simulate and see that they would be worked.
And because it's the 99 percent, the profile is a lot of improved.
We're facing the residues and we can use as fuel all of the residies from the reactors today.
Instead for them, for them. It's a great thing. It's a great thing.
It's inspiration as they're advanced. It's like a light.
You see here a kind of a pocket, called a "progressive with progressive."
In terms of the fuel, it actually solve the problem.
I have a picture of a place in Kentucky.
These are residures, the 99 percent of the room.
It's called poverty.
It cover needs of the United States for hundreds of years.
And by simple filtration of water in a sea sea process, we've got enough fuel for the whole life of the planet.
So we're waiting a lot of difficulty, but it's an example of many hundreds of ideas that we need to move.
Let's think, how could we evaluate us?
What should we look like our feet?
Well, let's see where we need to get, and then look at the intermediate pains.
For 2050 you've heard a lot of people talking about this 80 percent.
It's very important to get there.
And the 20 percent will be consumption of what's happening in poorest countries and over agriculture.
Let's hope that we're going to be silviculture.
To get to the 80 percent, the developed countries, including countries, including countries like China, they're going to modify their production of electricity around.
The other note is if we apply this technology with zero emissions, if we introduced into all the developed countries, and we're in the rest of the world.
That's super important.
This is a speech element in the notes of notes.
We do a step back: How should we look back: How should we look at notes from 2020?
Well, again, we should have two elements.
We're apply these efficiency efficiency to begin to have reductions.
The less less emitself, the smaller is going to be CO2 and so, so, the smaller temperature.
But in a way, the note that we get things that don't take us to the large reduction, is just equal or maybe it's a little bit more important than the other, which is the innovation of these progress.
These progress have to figure, and that we can measure with companies, and that we can measure on companies, pilot and regulations that have been changed.
There's been a lot of excellent books on this theme.
Al Gore's book, "Our" and "David MacKay," Energy. "
They're all at hand and creates a structure so that the world to discuss about these things, because we need a larger support for this.
It's got a lot of things to be done.
It's a wish.
It's a very concrete for us to invent this technology.
If I could choose me just a desire for the next 50 years, I could choose to be president, I could choose a vaccin, which I could choose a vaccin, which I could choose this: energy to half a couple of cost.
I would choose.
It's got the largest impact.
If you don't get this wish, the division between the people who think about short term on term and long-term is going to be terrible, between the poor and China, between the poorest and the rich, and especially of those two billion people will be more.
What do we need to do?
What do you go on on your movement to do more far and put it in the movement?
We need more requires of research.
When the countries get, for example at Copenhaga, I'm not just about CO2.
You should talk about this innovations.
They'll surprising how small of these innovative research for these innovative research.
It's also need market stimults of the CO2, the stimults of the cost.
We have to spread the message.
It has to be more rational to become more rational, including measuble, including measuble, including the government.
It's an important desire, but I think we can do it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Just to understand more about TerraPower, first of all, you can provide an idea of investment?
Bill Gates: To make the software, bought, bought the supercomputer, the employees of competent scientists, which we're just tens of millions.
Even after we're testing materials in a rush rush to be safe that our materials works how we need, we're going to get to hundreds of millions.
The difficult thing is the construction of the pilot reactors, find some billion, authorities, the amplashment of the first.
After the first, if you're building the first, if it's clear, it's clearly different from the world, because the economy density, is very different from the common.
CA: So, to understand how do we need, this is building in the ground, to a deep kind of a vertical column of fuel fuel fuel, and then the process begins, and then the process starts out, and then the process starts down and somehow?
BG: Well, it's all the time you have to do the reactor, that there's lots of people and many devices that can be hard, in that place where you opens and outside.
That's not good.
If you've got very cheaper fuel that you can leave there 60 years -- we can put it up there with a pocket -- we can't have the same complexity.
It's just sitting there and 60 years old, and then it's ready.
CA: It's a nuclear center that's also the elimination solution.
BG: Yeah. Well, what's happening to residues, you can leave them there -- there's much less resides in the way -- and then you can actually take and put it in the other.
And we begin with the residues that there are today, is now in circumstances or at reactors.
From this fuel beyond fuel.
The thing represents a problem for these reactors is actually the first for our reactors, and we reduce the volume's actually considerably by this process.
CA: But in different discussion with different people from everybody in the world in concrete with possibilities, where you found the biggest interest to do something concrete?
BG: I didn't chose a precisely and there's all these rules of nuclear field.
We're interested in a lot, that people in company have gone in Russia, China.
I met here with the energy minister of the energy minister, and I talked about the place of this ideas in energy agenda.
I'm optimist. I'm an optimist. Let's have done something.
This is a variation of something has done.
It's an important development, but it's like a quickly reactor and many countries have built, so any of the countries that have built a fast can be built the first of them.
CA: What do you've got, when the probability is going to realize concrete?
BG: For of one of the big electric generates that's very cheap 20 years to invent it and then 20 years to involve it and then 20 years to implement it.
That's a limited term that we have showed us that we need to breathe.
And TerraPower, if things go well, what's a big desire, it may respect.
Now, there's in happiness, tens of companies, we need to be hundreds, which is, if they're funding for their pilot reactors goes, they can conteach for that.
And it's the best if I've been able to combine it.
We need one to do it.
CA: Is changes in large-scale, is this largest that you know?
BG: A energy revolution is the most important thing.
It would have been even without the environmental limitations, but the environmental limitations I'm doing it with the more significant.
In nuclear field are more and other innovators.
You know, we don't know them work as well like this, but there's those who are going on on ways, which is another way.
There's also a liquid of liquid acor, which seems a little bit difficult, but it maybe it's also about us.
So there's a variety.
The beauty is that a molecule of uranium has a million times more energy than we say, one million times more energy than we say, one of coal.
So, if we can solve the negative parts, which is essence of the radiation, the costage, the costage, the potential, like effect on the field and so on, it's almost form that it's almost form that it's one classroom.
CA: But if it doesn't work?
We're going to have to start taking emergency to keep temperature temperature?
BG: If we get to this situation is like when you're eating too much and you're on the point of being a cord.
That's when you're doing? You can need cardiry surgery or something.
There's a research direction in what the geoengineering geoengineering, which is different techniques to deal with 20 or 30 years, until we organize.
But that's just a police of surance.
We hope we don't need it.
Some people say that we're not even working on the police police, because we may be able to eat because we know that we're going to continue to eat because we know that we're going to save us that we're going to save our churgia.
I don't think that's wisdom, but there's in the importance of the problem, but there's in case in case in case, or whether this innovation goes more slowly than we expect.
CA: Sceptics of climate change: in a sentence or two, what you're wrong?
BG: I'm skeptics in different table.
Those scientific arguments are very few.
I'm saying that there's negative effects of negative that modify things?
There's very few things that they can say.
They've got a million to be right.
The main problem here is kind of like AIDS.
You make mistake now and pay for it much later.
When you have all kinds of emergency problems, the idea is to take a win later, and it's kind of trying.
In fact, we have IPCC, which doesn't reflect the worst case, and there are people in the rich world who's looking at the IPCC and say, not that big thing.
In fact, it's just supposed to motivate us to this.
But my dream here is to get a economic randament and simultaneously to breathe and CO2, and then skeptics going to say, well, I don't care about CO2, but I'd just like to do it for CO2, but I've got it because it '
CA: So this would be your answer to Bjorn Lomborg's argument for Bjorn Lomborg, who says that if they're consumption for the other goes, to try to get out of the poverty, to try to get the world's charge, and it '
BG: In fact, we're spending and development -- to say that the U.S. We should say that the United States should be spend with 10 billion a year more than now -- there's not that dramatic.
It's not covered other things.
The thing that you spend a lot, and here people are resonable, and here people can't agreement, it's when you're trying to funding something economic.
That, for me, it's a lot of risip, in the situation when you're alone, and you're just going to be very cheap.
I think we should try a lot more things that have the potential to be much more cheaper.
If we get to the compromise to make super expensive energy, then rich.
Anyone of us here could pay five times more on the energy without changing our style of life.
It's for the two billion.
And I actually Lomborg changed.
The position now is, why don't you talk more about research?
It's because of things in the past is continuing associated with sceptics, but he realized that it's a fairly themselves, so it's the problem of the research.
It's a correct of something right, I think.
The research and development, it's crazy of research is.
CA: Bill, I suppose that I'm talking in the name of the most of here when I say that I'm looking at you very much.
BG: Thank you.
I want to share with you a discovered a few months ago, while I was writing an article for Italian Wired.
When I write, I've always on the dictionary.
But I'd already written the article and realized that I'd never seeing the word "disability's in the dictionary.
Let me read your definition.
"Dizability's" Dizability,'s substantially: "infirm, useful, destructed, squately, stagnately, stagnately, stagnated, such a mutilodishifted, squatured, spoted,
You're seeing and slab.
Antonime: healthy, powerful, capable.
I read the list of a friend and laughed.
It was absurface.
As I've gone in '"schilody" schilody's, and I had to ststop to my emotional city of these words.
It was my old dictionary.
I thought, maybe, it's been typical.
But he came out of the pattern beginning of the '80s, when I was starting to understand where I was starting to understand where I'd begin to understand where I'm starting to the other children around me.
Slave Domnine, I didn't use a dictionary.
After this definition, it looks like I've been born in a world that someone like myself has no positive experience.
But today, I'm grateful for opportunities and adventures that I've been doing.
So, I've been looking for immediately in 2009, hope to find a major modification.
Here's the new version of definition.
Unfortunately, it's no better.
The last two words, under '"Aproape'" Aproape's, "and" and's "and's" and's "vigorous."
Not only words are the problem.
It's what we think about people we think about the people we call in this way.
It's about the values of the words of words and how we build them.
Our language is affects our thinking and the way we see the world and other people.
In fact, a lot of ancient societies, including grecks and romans, they thought that a blest-emis very strong, because when you're saying with voice, it making it exists.
So what do we want to create?
A person who has limitations or a strong person?
So, in fact that we call a man, a child, we could sit the power that it has.
Wouldn't be better to open it a door?
A man who opened me a doctor of my childhood in childhood, from the A.I. Institutor, Delaware.
His name's name is Dr.
The American original American, whose name seems like it's too difficult by American.
So he was told Dr.P.
Dr.P. "It's always colored to work with children.
I was spent the time spent in the hospital, exception of physical therapy.
I had to make exercise exercises with these high elastic benefits, to ask my muscle.
We're all of the soul of those bends.
We've got them.
Although, I'd already five years already and I was trying to get those exercise, of course without any successful.
One day, he came to my faith --
They were -- there were some dysics and faith --
and he said, "Aimee, you're a little girl," I'm "that I think you're going to reach one of these bends."
But what he has done was to transform a daily obligation in a new and promises.
And I wonder, and I ask today in the fact that I'm a strong influenced the way that I see me today, like a powerful person and atletic person.
That's an example of the way that adults can take the power of a child.
But by those definitions of the dictionary, our language, we don't allow us to create the reality that we all want, possibility that an individual to consider the capable.
Our language is not at current with the societies, many of them being produced by technology.
Of course, from a medical point of view, my legs, my legs, the operation with laser deficiency deficiency, which allows people to put them into their skills, and they've allowed to take their abilities, and they're limited to the nature of their abilities.
Maybe technology now, what's happening now, what was always true.
The fact that every single man has a strong and strong by society, and that human ability to adapt is the biggest win.
The human apacity to adapt is an interesting thing, because people will always have to talk about the adversity of the adversity and I'm going to talk to you a mat.
I've never liked this expression, and we answered the questions about it.
I think I began to understand why.
It's happening in the problem of the adversity is that success or happiness is that success or happiness is that successful or without having the married of this, as how successfully successes in the ability to stocoli with a lives of a lives, or what they 'in the capacity of a lives, or.'
But, in fact, we're very good at a physical challenge or emotional challenge or emotional challenge or emotional challenge or emotional challenge.
I want to suggest that this is a good thing.
Adversity is not an obstacle that we need to be able to move, so we can live our lives.
It's part of our life.
I think it's kind of a shadow.
Sometimes I see it quite a lot, but it's always less, but it's always with me.
I don't try to try to get a person with adversity.
In life, there's adversity and challenges for each of us, but it's not if you meet this adversity, but the way you'll react to it.
So our debt is not just to protect the adversity of the adversity that we love, but also to prepared them to fight it.
We're doing it a kids deserves, when we make them feel inable to adapt.
There's an important difference between medical fact that we have suffered an amputation and opinion of society, if we or not a dizability.
And to be honest, the real dizability that I've been confronted that I've been confront of those definitions.
Our desire to protect the ones that we love, telling them the truth of the diagnosis, saying the diagnosis about the diagnosis of their lives, we have to take care of not the first that we've got to be inferred.
The fact that you see what's wrong with yourself can be much harder than pathology.
Because we don't treat the person in the totality, and we don't resistance, we've transmit the other problems that they have.
We've basically the importance of that man in society.
So we need to see through pathology things that's capable of a man.
And especially, there's formed a partnership between those deficiences and the biggest creator.
We don't have to be alorizing these difficult moments, to avoid or to avoid them or to move them with the view, but to find the opportunities that we're adversity.
The idea that I want to support is not only to get out of the adversity, but we'll open it up to it, but also open it up to it, to get a sportable, maybe to use a sportive term, maybe we can actually dance with it.
And maybe we're going to see the adversity as a natural and useful, something that doesn't go down.
In this year, Charles Darwin ages 200 years ago, and when it was 150 years ago, when it was writing about evolution, Darwin has a truth about the human character.
To paraphrase, I don't the strongest species survival, but that can get to change.
The conflict generate creation.
In Darwin's work, among other things, we can see that human ability to survive, and to figure out is impulse by the human spirit, from conflict to transformation.
One sudden, transformation is the biggest atrival of human.
And maybe, until we're tested, we don't know why we are able.
Maybe this gives us adversity: a sense of synelse, knowledge of our power.
So we can do our only one gift.
We can redefine the adversity as something longer than some harder times.
We can see it as a change.
Adversity is the change that we don't yet.
I think the biggest adversity I created is the idea of normality.
Who is normal?
There's no normality.
There's a common of communicate, but not normal.
And you've got to know a person like a person?
I don't think.
If we can change this paradigm from aspiracy to normality or force, to say a little bit more, we can release the force of many children, and we can release them to use their valuable skills in community.
Anthropologists tell us that the only thing we asked, people from the community members of the community was to be.
He discovered that the Neanderthal Neanderthal, 60,000 years ago, whether they've been discover 60,000 years ago, and maybe their experience of survival, and maybe their experience proved to community.
They didn't see these people like infirms or unusefs.
They were considered and valuable.
A couple years ago, I was in a house in my hometown, in that red area in the Native of Pennsylvania, and I was looking at a red box.
It was a summer. We were in short pants.
I heard the voice of a man behind me, "I've heard," I've come back and saw a old that I didn't even know.
I said, "Move." We know? "We know? I don't remember." And he said, "You don't know."
"When we've met, we'd just helped,"
So he was.
And I remembers.
That man was Dr.Kean, a man I knew, a man I knew's stories of my mom, because, as usually, I've come up with a couple of weeks.
And the doctor's my mother's doctor.
So the one that has helped to my parents was a stranger for my parents.
And because I've been born without the tyboard and just a few fingers at the legs, and just a few degees, he had to get their bad needs.
He said, "I had to say," I have to say "parents'" that you'll never go. ""
"But you've demonstrated that I demonstrated." "What's extraordinarily is that it's been such as a childhood.
When I won the ortograph in the second classroom in the second classroom, when I was with other research in the Halloween park, when I went to college or my sports.
He's given them example of residents, our students from the Hahnemann schools and Herey.
And this called "X 'Factor's' The 'Factor, the potential of human.
No diagnoscouldn't sit in the power of your power quality of someone's life.
And Dr.Kean said, "" My's my experience, if you didn't say, "" and if it's offer and the smallest supply, "" if it's leave a child 'he's the way,'
Dr.Kean has done that change in mentality.
He understood that there's a difference between the diagnosis and the way that someone react to it.
And my mentality changed over time.
If you've been asked about 15 years, if I would protect the change of meanings, and I didn't have any second.
On the time, I aspiram to that kind of normality.
If you ask me today, I'm not so sure.
And that's what's like, "" "--
Maybe this change in me, because I've been exposed because I've been exposed to many people who have opened me in front of them.
So, you see, you don't need a person to have a person to have the revelation of your power, and you're on the good way.
If you can provide them of his own power, the human spirit's, the human spirit is so receive -- if you can do this and open somebody's opens it as we need to.
You're learning to open it up their door.
In fact, the word "education's" education "education."
That's what it's inside, to get out of the potential value.
So, quickly, what is potential to do we want to get out of evidence?
There was a case of case in Britain, in the '60s, when they've gone from the classic schools to the differentiate.
It's categorission.
They're separated with the students, with C, with C, etc.
Elevents had a harder program, the best teachers, the best teachers.
For three months, students with notes are received A, he was told that they're smart.
After this performance of three months, they had performance. A.
The way of medalia was that the students has been told him that I'm the notes of the D.
And this happened after the three months.
Some were in school. Some of them were in school.
The crucial part of this study is that the teachers have been silent.
They didn't know that it changed anything.
They're told people who have to do.
And they treated them corresponds.
I think the only handicay is a zeebroken spirit, which doesn't have hope.
It's not seeing beauty.
It doesn't have the natural curiosity and the ability to imagine their imagine.
If, instead, we can determines the spirit of a man to keep their hope, to see beauty in itself and others, to be curiosely and others, to be curious and elds of imagination, means that we use our power as we need.
When a spirit has those qualities, we can create new realities and new ways of being.
I want to leave you with a poem, written by a popersan in second-four, named Hafiz, which I've told me Jacques Dembois.
The poetry is called "" God who knows just four words. "
"Every child known to God."
"Vino and dancing me." I thank you.
