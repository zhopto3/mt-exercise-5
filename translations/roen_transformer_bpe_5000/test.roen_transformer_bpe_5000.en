A few years ago, here at TED, Peter Ster has showed a design problem that we called the problem.
And the idea is pretty simple.
And it's how many four has to build the highest strengths of spaghetetti, a winter of winter, a winter of the layer and a dry winter.
Bezua has to stay in the top.
And even though it looks pretty simple, it's, it's really hard, because it's forced people to do very quickly.
And so I thought that this is an interesting idea, and I've embedded it into a design seminary seminary seminary.
And it was a great success.
And since then, I kept about 70 design seminaries all over the world with designers and designers and architects, even the directors from the top 50 Fortune, and something of this practice, and I'd like to share some of the collaboration, and I'd like to share a few.
So, normally people are starting by avoiding task.
It's about it, they imagine what it's going to look like, they're going to look like, and then organizing.
Skets and arannies their spaghetand spending most of the time assembling the bees in the structures that will then, at the end, even though they don't have time, someone dry, and it's a part, and Tda.
It's the work.
But what's actually going on, in most of them, is that, "Oh," yes, "because weight," weight, "weight," weight, "weight?"
And there's a number of people who have a lot of moments of people who have a lot of moments than others, and amongst the most unrefinding the business.
And they lie, cheats, they lose their focus, and they're able to focus structures.
And of course, I'm the teams that they have much more "structures," and, amongst the best, are the highest propositions of graduate.
And it's pretty amazing.
As Peter says Peter tells us, not just produce the highest structures, but the most interesting structures of all.
So you'd like you'd like to ask, why?
And Peter them like to say, "None of the kids don't lose time trying to be directly at SRL SRL." That's.
And they don't lose time fight for power.
But there's another reason.
This is that the students are trained to find the only plan correct, isn't it?
And I'm executed it.
And what happens?
It's a crisis.
It sounds known? That's right.
What I'm doing different from the garden, is that they are starting with the beekeepers, and they build prototypes, and they've got more opportunity to remediate the prototypes, so they have more opportunity to remediate the prototypes.
So the designers this type of collaboration as the essence of the process.
And every version, the kids have an immediately response to what it works and what they don't work.
So the ability to build in prototype is essential, and let's see how different team of teams.
So the media is about 20 countries, students, I'm about 20 countries, I'm about half, vocations, a little better as most adults.
Who is the best?
Architects and engineers, unfortunately, the highest structure that we've seen has 39 countries.
And why is that? Because they understand that triangles and high-geometrical models are the key construction of itself.
So, general directors, a little better than media.
But here's what's interesting.
If you add the team of a human from administrative administrative results.
It's incredible. You see, you're around and say, "That's the team."
Can you say that before. And why?
Because they have special skills of facilitation.
They drive the process, I understand the process.
And any team that monititors, and it's attention to work to improve their performance.
The facility technical and facility, and their combination leads to guarantee.
If you have 10 teams that they start to build, you're going to have six structures that they're going to sit.
And I tried something interesting.
I thought, let's increase mise.
And I've provided a 10,000 dollars in informatical programs to waste.
And what do you think that's happened to design students?
What was the result?
Here's what happened.
No team did not build something that would stay in the legs.
If a team would be built, say, a three-centimeter structure of three centimeters, could be able to take home.
So, isn't it interesting the mizes have a powerful impact?
We repeated the practice with those students.
What do you think it happened?
They're now doing the prototype of the prototype.
And the same team has gone from the slab to one of the best outcomes.
They got the highest structure into the shortest time.
So here are some deep lessons for us about the nature of reasons and successful.
So, you might ask, "Why someone would you lose like this?
And the reason is, I'm helping to create digital tools and processes use video games and video games and visual effects.
And what this is doing this challenge is helping them to identify the assumptions.
Because, in fact, every project has its own beat, right?
This challenge us a communication, a common language, a common language, a common position, a common position of a prototype prototype.
And so, this is the value of this experience, this exercise so simple.
And for those who are interested, you can access ww.marshmallowchallenge is a blog where you can see how to build with bees.
I'm also instructions of step with step.
They're also unusual examples of all the world of how people change and help the system.
You can find world records.
And the fundamental lessons, I think it's the design is really a contact sport.
It's asking us to dedicate the task all of our senses, and we've got better in thinking, feelings and the facts for the challenge in front of us.
And sometimes, a simple prototype of this experience is the only thing to transform a moment, "oh," oh-oh "at a moment."
And that can make the difference.
Thank you very much.
So let's assume we have this machinery, a large machinery, TED style, which is a time car.
And everyone's in this room has to go into it.
You can go back or forward, but you can't stay where you are.
I wonder what you're going to choose, because I asked my friends, I asked my friends this question in the last weather, and they all wanted to travel back in time.
I don't know. They're going to come back to the automobile, before Twitter or "American Idol.
I don't know.
I'm sure there's this attraction.
But I have to mention that I'm not part of this group.
I don't want to go back in time, and I don't want me to take adventure, but because the palette of options on this planet doesn't regulate, but it's adventure.
So, I want to go back.
It's the best period of this planet in any viewpoints: health, wealth, mobility, chance, mobility, chance, deployee, describes.
And there was no time.
My grandparents died before to fulfilling 60 years.
My grandparents got to 70.
My parents's about 80.
So it would be good numbers at the beginning of the top that I'm going to die.
But it's not even about people like this, because it's much more important than that.
A child who's born today in New Delhi has a bigger life expectancy than it had the world in 100 years ago.
Think about it. It's an incredible phenomenon.
And why is true?
Variola. Variola killer killed billions of people.
It's the demographic data of the planet in a unequal way of nothing else.
It's no longer. She's gone.
I've been doing it. Power!
In the rich world, the diseases that have millions of people have just a generation behind.
Diftery, related, polio --
Anybody knows what that means?
Vaccines, our modern drugs, our our ability to feed billions of people are triumpes of science.
And I'm thinking that the scientific method, put the things to see if it works, to change them if it doesn't represent one of the most achievement of humanity.
These are good news.
Unfortunately, there's no longer there are other problems, because there are other problems, mentioned many times, one of them is that despite all of our achievement, a billion people sleep every day.
This number increases very quickly, and it's to be convicted.
It's not just that, but we used imagination to destroy this planet.
Water, the agricultural land, rainforests, rainforests, the gas: they're all going to go away.
If we don't invent a way of getting out of this room, we're going to go away.
The question is: Can we do that? I think yes.
I think it's obvious that we can produce food to feed billions of people who live.
I think we can food this world with energy that doesn't destroy it.
I really think it's not just an illusion.
But here's what I don't let me want to sleep.
We've never had to have the progress of science than now, and we've ever learned in the situation of using it in how we can do it today.
We're in the praging events in many fields.
However, I think we should go back with three hundred years, before Epoet Epoet, to discover a period in order to discover a period where we fight for progress, for all of these things and more fronts than now.
People are champony fanatically convictions that you can't free.
It doesn't even release.
Everybody has the right to an opinion; it actually has the right to have an opinion about progress, but you know what you don't have the right?
You don't have the right at your own truth. I'm sorry, but this is.
And it took me some time to figure that.
Now, about 10 years ago, I wrote an article about vaccines for "The New Yorker's a small article.
I was amazed to be a bit of fitting, against what, at the end, is the most efficient measurements of public health since from the entire history of humanity.
I didn't know what to do, so I did what I usually do, I wrote a article of walked away.
And after that, I wrote an article about genetic modified food.
The same thing, only most important.
People have taken her razy.
So I wrote an article and about that, and I couldn't understand why people believed it is "food of Frankenstein", "why they believed the molecules in a particular way, not in one random, meant the laws of nature.
But as you already know, I'm doing what I'm doing. I went on.
I'm just journalist; we're archive, we're going to dinner, we're going on.
But these articles me up and I didn't know what. And then I understood.
It was because those phanatics that would take me out of the minds were not a phanatics.
There were people with good, they're educated, to their place.
They were exactly like people in this room.
And it boat me so much --
but then I thought, let's be honest.
We are in the point where we don't have the same relationship with progress so far.
We're talking about it.
We're talking about him in ironic term, let's put it between the ice: "Progress."
OK, there's reasons for that, and I think we know that are these reasons.
We had lost their belief in institutions, in authority and sometimes even in science.
And we have the right to do it.
You can turn some name and people will understand.
Cernoble, Bhopal, Vioxx, Vioxx, the array of destruction in mass.
You can other list.
There's questions and about people that I thought they've always been right.
So, be circumstances.
Basks questions, solicited the evidence and probe.
You don't take any good.
But here's the idea: when you get evidence, you have to accept them. We don't really good at that.
And I can say, because we're in the midst of an epidemic of the fear scale to now, and that I hope you don't meet.
And about 12 years ago, there was an article, a terrible one, one of the connection between the autism epidemic and the vaccine against the brief against the bridge of the poor, and the rub.
Very frightening.
They've done their studies to check if that's true.
They had to make the nenums of studies; it's an important problem.
They've come and the results.
Results in the United States, in the U.K., in the U.K., and they were all saying that: there's no correlation, no connection, no connection.
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter, because we take the world serious, because we're looking at, we're seeing, which makes us feel real.
We don't believe a whole lot of documents to a government functioning data that gives us and understand that, I think we're all doing.
But you know something?
The results were disaster, and here's why: the United States is one of the few countries in the world in which the pregnant vaccination against pray is.
That's unfinding, it should be shame.
It's terrible.
What happened to do we got here?
I understand, I understand.
Anyone here has anyone here?
He saw anyone else in the audience anyone else's audience?
It doesn't really happen.
That's not happening, but it's 160,000 times in the entire world last year.
A lot of deaths because of the bridge, 20 cases on hour.
But, because here we can't think about this, and we can't think about it, and people like Jenny McCarthy can propells of fear and ignorance using emissions like the Oprah and Give King Live.
And I can do that because they don't make that difference between cause and corelation.
They don't understand that this same thing, but never coincide.
And we need to learn this as soon.
This guy, Jonas Sulk, was a hero.
It's got rid of one of the largest of humanity.
Without fear, no agony, the polio, it's gonna disappeared.
This guy in the middle -- not too.
She Paul Offit.
They've developed a vaccine on a rotating don't with other wheels.
It's 400,000 lives of children in the developing countries every year.
His result, right?
It's good, just Paul talks about vaccines and how pretious they're the vaccinous, and that people should just slow.
Right.
So Paul is a terrorist.
When Paul talks in a public audience, he can't put marriage without being protected by guns.
It's called at home because people like to say that I'd like to say that I'm school,
Why Paul made a vaccine.
I don't need to say that, but vaccines are essential.
If you reach them, disease comes, terrible disease disease, and that's what's happening right now.
In this country, we've got relatives now.
It's increasing and worse, and soon, the children will die again, children will die again, because it's just a statistical problem.
And they won't just want to die.
What about polio with polio? Let's have this. Why not?
Two weeks ago, a college of college written me and told me that they're kind of strident.
Nobody else said to me this.
He didn't have thought to vaccinate their child against the polio.
In any case.
All right.
Why? Because we don't we have polio.
There were no polio cases of polio in this country.
Today, though I don't know, maybe a guy's going on in the morning at Los Angeles, and it's going to land on the Ohio.
It's going to land over two hours, will open a car and come to Long Beach and come to go to one of these beautiful TED dyes in this evening.
It doesn't know that it's infected with a disease, and we don't know, because that's how the world works.
This is the planet that we live. Let's not pretend that it's not pretend.
We like to teach us in my lies. We like that at crazy.
And he took everybody's in the morning?
EChinese, slightly antioxide to work.
I know you did that because half the U.S. population does that every day.
It's all of this, and it's in alternative medicine, and it doesn't matter how often we're completely unuseless.
The data shows every same thing.
They make it closer to color, no longer.
It's okay, you're going to pay 28 billions of dollars for open to color.
You don't have.
I'm going to color.
Why do we do that?
I think we're seeing the great pharmaceutical producers of pharmaceutical producers.
We're not trust the government. We don't trust.
And we shouldn't have to have. Our public health care is nasol.
It's crude millions of people.
It's unbelievable and destruction of those who can allow you.
So he's fuse it. And we're running?
It's about raising array.
It's fantastic. I love the great placebo.
But, in fact, it's something very serious, because these things are tapes and spend billions of dollars.
I've got all sorts of things.
None of them -- the Qukgo, the falls, the weren't even know what, but we spend billions of dollars on that, I don't even know what, but we're spending billions of dollars.
And you know what? When I'm saying that, and I'm saying, "What do you care?" "
Do you know it? You know.
Because I don't care if the secretary of Health's Minister of Health is the one that says, "Hmm, I don't take my experts on the mammography," or it's want to treat the patient.
When you put it on the way that the belief and magic are replacing the evidence and science, you're going into a place where you don't want to be.
Ajungi's South Africa of Thabo Mbeki.
And he killed 400,000 people insisting that the wheels, sheer and the lemen of hands are much more efficient than the antiretroviral drugs that we know that I slow down the AIDS progress.
He's absolutely free than thousands of absolute deaths in a country that disease.
Please, don't tell me that there's no consequences for that.
There's. There's.
The most lack of the epidemic that has occurcurred us right now is that the absursurvey of the food degree of genetic disorders.
It's a controversy. They have to start to stop.
It's a private controversy to the metaphors.
It's ideology, not.
Any, we eat, every rush board, every son of the Bruxelles, every single whose by Bruelles was modified by human.
In the Eddidn't extend.
And you don't get yellow.
There weren't the Christmas. We did it.
I did that over the last 1,000 years.
Some of them have been fine, not.
I got rid of the ones that weren't.
Now we can do it in a more exactly way.
Of course, there are risks.
But we can put vitamin A rice, and that can help millions of people, just millions of people, just by making their lives.
Don't you want to do that?
I have to marry that I don't understand.
We're doing genetic change.
Why do we do that?
Well, we're always hearing things like: Prea many chemicals, hormones, hormones, hormones, we don't want the giant surface, it's wrong.
We don't want companies that to patent life.
We don't want companies that to desire.
Do you know what my answer to this?
Yes, you're right. Let's repair it.
This is, we have a big problem with food, but that doesn't science.
That's nothing to do with science.
It's law, it's morality, patents.
You know science is not represented by a company.
It's not a country.
It's not even an idea; it's a process.
It's a process that sometimes works, and they're not, but the idea that we shouldn't be able to make their work, because we're afraid is very described and millions of people to thrive.
In the next 50 years, we will have to produce 70 percent more food than today.
70 percent.
Here's what investments have been done in Africa for the last 30 years.
Right. It's shaminos.
They need that, and we don't give them.
Why? Other change genetic genetic.
We don't want to encouraging people to eat the portrait of people to eat the portrait as manner.
500 million people eat at all.
It's kind of like a carton.
Only calories. It's terrible.
It doesn't have no nutritious substance, and the scientists are introduced all of that in it right now.
And then people will be able to eat it without hit.
Don't suffer from hungry and you know something?
It wouldn't be like Chez Panisse, but it would be good.
All I can say is: Why do we fit?
Let's asking this question: Why do we fit?
Because we don't want to change genes?
It's just about changing genes. It's not about chemicals.
It's not about our high passion passion for hormones, about insistence of having higher dimensions, better food.
It's not about the demand for the myth, it's about keeping people in life, and it's time to understand what that means.
Because, you know?
If we don't do it, if we're going to keep us, we're going to be guilty, and that's high-tech colonization.
We can't described other way that's happening.
It's egod, it's under our level and we really need to stop.
So, after this incredible conversation, you may say, "So," So, you're going to go into this charge? "
Of course. I'm sure.
It's now presented in the present, but we have an amazing opportunity.
We can code the time anyway.
We can move anywhere we want, and that's what we're going to do.
We have to wear these discussions, and we need to think, but when we hit in the time, we're going to be thank that we do that.
I know that we can and after my opinion, that's just need the world now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And one day, Steve Lopez at Los Angeles Times the streets of the Los Angeles Times, when he heard a beautiful music.
And the source was a man, an American African, delighted, unclear, a man of stranger, a man of stranger, playing at a violence that had just two coards.
And I'm telling you a story that many of you, because Steve wrote a lot of articles that have become the basis of a book, and the Robert Downey Jamie Fox like Nathony, and Jamie Fox like Nathony Ayers, and Jamie Fox in the Ayers, the Ayers of the Ayers, the Tyers of the Ayers with the Ayer traging tragege of the P-aniel Anyers panel Anthony Ayers treyers a brier, and the Tyers, a brier, a, and the P--------aniel Anyers with the P-aniel An-----aniel Anyers
Nathaniel gave up the school, went through a traffic truth, and 30 years later, no house, live on the streets of Skid Row in the center Angelesis.
I recommend everyone to look at Steve's book, or see the movies to understand not just the beautiful bond that connected to these two people, and as the music has helped to make that connected to the formation, and it was the instrumental, for the game of words, to help Nathwon't hit the day.
I've met Ayers in 2008, two years ago, two years ago, to concerts the Walt Disney.
He'd listening to the symphony first and the fourth of the Beethoven and came back behind the stage and showed it.
He's talking about a very game and social about Yo-Yo-Yo-Ma and Hillary Clinton and Hillary Clinton, and that's Dodgers won't get into the final strengthoven.
And I spoke about music. And I got a email from Steve a few days later, saying that Nathaniel was interested in a late lesson with me.
Now, I have to mention that Nathaniel refused to do treatment because when he was treated with a chief therapy and Thorazine and Thorazine and Thorazine and marriage, and that's what they're going to stay them.
But as a result now, it's prewilling to these schizophrenic episodes.
The worst of them can manifestate that he's going on, and I'm desperate for many days in Skid Row, exposed to those orders, with the torture in his mind unlead.
And Nathaniel was very agitated when our first lesson the Walt sala Disney had a kind of scale of miserable writing, was lost.
And he was talking about invisible devisible, and anybody else in sleep.
And it was afraid, not for me, but it was afraid that I'm going to lose it in one of his star, and that I'm going to destroy the relationship of the worth of his relation to life.
So I started playing.
And I played the first part of the concert of the Beethoven's worth.
And as I've been playing change in Nathaniel's eyes in Nathaniel.
It was like being under the influence of invisible drugs, a chemical reaction, a chemical reaction, which music played by me was the catalyze.
And the Nathaniel of Nathaniel was transformed in understanding, a silver and degree.
And as a miracle, he raised his own violin, and he started to play, after the ears, some fragments of concerts that I asked me to fill, Mendelssohn, Tikovy, Taly, Sibus.
And I started talking about music, from Bach to Bach Beethoven, and Brahms, Bruckner, all of the letter of B, from Bartók, to Esa-Peka.
And I understood that he didn't only have knowledge about music, but had a personal connection to music.
He was talking about it with that passion and understanding that I'm sharing with my colleagues from the movie Angeles.
And as I was interprepreted, and I was talking about the music that was transformed from a paranoid, which was just coming from the streets in the center of Los Angelesa, in this delightful musician, a genial musician.
Musics is therapy. Musics changes us.
And for Nathaniel, the music is psychological health.
Because the music allows them to take their own thoughts and illusions, and turn them through the imagination and its creativity, in reality.
And this is a state of his suffering.
And I understood that's the essence of the art.
This is the reason why we do music, we're doing something that we're in our fundamental, our emotions, and with our artistic filters, with our creativity, we model those emotions.
And the reality of that expressions us all, and it's impressed us, and it inspire us.
And for Nathaniel, the music brought him back to the friends.
The power power of the music brought him back into a family of musicians who understood, who recognize the talents and they respect it.
I'm always going to do music with Nathaniel, or in Skid Row, or in Skid Row, because it bringing me to remember what I've become a musician.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Thank you. Thank you.
Robert Gupta.
Robert: I'm going to play something that I angry with no Russians.
So, please me.
I'm Jane McGonigal. I'm a game designer.
I'm making online games for 10 years now.
And my purpose for the next decade is to try to easily save the world in the same way that can save the world in online games.
Now, I've got a plan for this, and that's to convincing more world, including those presented and better games.
Today, we spend three billion hours a week playing online games.
Some of you may think, "It's a lot of time a games."
Maybe too much time, holding on an emergency problems, we have to solve in the real world.
But, according to my research, at the Institute for Viitor, is exactly the dos.
Third billion hours on the ground is not even long enough time of game to solve the most emerge problems of the world.
Actually, I think, if we want to survive the century on this planet, we have to increase dramatically this number of hours.
We've all calculated that we need at 21 billion game every week.
So, that's probably an intuitive idea.
So I'm going to say again, I'll leave it again.
If we want to solve problems like hunger, poverty, climate change, the global conflicts, obedity, I think we need to take to play to play online game game games for the least 21 billion hours a week to the end of this decade. I'm not serious.
Here's why. This picture is going to religion what I think games are so critical for the future the survival of human species.
That's a photographer called the Phil Toledano.
He wanted to captures the toy.
So, a camera in front of the players, while they're playing.
And this is a classical emotion of play.
Now, if you're not a gamer might be able to lose part of the nuances of this picture.
And you probably notice the need of action, a frightforward, but the concentration of intense concentration, very strong focus of a very difficult problem.
If you're a player, you'll notice a few shoes like the rides your eyes are signs of optimism.
And blood blood blood is a surprise sign.
This is a gamer that's almost something called a win.
Oh, you've heard of that. OK.
So we have something among us.
A won't won't think you can't think you could touch it until you won't won't know it.
It was almost beyond the limits of the imagination.
And when you get there you're so shocked to discover that you're able to find that you're capable. This is a win.
That's a player on the way to get a win.
And that's the face we need to see the millions of people who solve problems from all the world as we're trying to get out of the next century.
It's someone who, against sister, it's about getting a win.
Now, unfortunately, that's a face that we see more often in our lives of day, as we're issing us of emergency problems.
That's what I call the face of "I'm not good at living."
And here's my face. Can you see? Yes. Can you see? Yeah. Okay. Okay.
That's really me taking the face of "I'm not good at living."
Here's a graffiti of graffiti in my old neighborhood.
from Berkley, California, where I took my doctor about the reasons why we are better in games than in real life.
And that's a problem that many gamers have.
We feel that we're not as good as we are in games.
And I don't mean good as in "successful," even if that's a component of us, we're actually doing a lot of real games than in real life, but when I'm telling me to do something that matters, inspired to cooperate and cooperate.
And when we are virtual worlds, I think many of us become our best version of us become our best version of us, the most likely to be able to focus on a moment, the most likely to focus on a failure and try and try.
In real life, when we're facing the face of failure, when we're facing our face with obstacles, the most don't feel like this.
We're ourselves.
We're anxious, you can depressed, frustrated or dinner.
We don't have that kind of feeling when we play, they're just not in games.
So, that's what I wanted to study when I finished my college.
What's in games makes sense of sure that there's nothing that we can do?
How can we take these feelings of games and apply them to the real work in real life?
So I looked at games like World of Warcraft, which is really a collaboration environment of collaboration to solve problems.
And I started to notice a couple of things that make epical waste so they're in online worlds.
So, the first thing is that if you come in one of these online games in the World of Warcraft, you find a lot, many character, many characters that are willing to convey a mission that may save the world, immediately.
But don't you mission, but a mission mission mission mission in your game. Right?
So, you can lead it to remote it.
I'm never going to give you an attempt.
But that's the limit of what you can do. So, you have to get you pretty much.
But there's no homage in the World of Warcraft.
There's no state state state, and it loss.
There's always something that's important to do.
And they're also tons of collaborators.
Anywhere you go, hundreds of thousands of people's ready to work with you to work with you to work with your ethical mission.
It's not something that's possible in real life, this feeling that in your own life, this feeling that in your own life are tons of collaborators.
And in addition, it's this ethical story, this story full of inspiration about what we're doing.
And then you get this positive feedback.
You've heard of growth in the level, and I'm going to be able to pay to intelligence.
We don't get that kind of constantly feedback in real life.
When I'm going to leave this scene, I wouldn't have been talking about, and I'm unleading 20 to live ideas.
I don't get that feedback in real life.
Now, the problem with collaboration like the World of collaboration is that it's so satisfying to be on the point of earlier to wise something epic all the time we're deciding to spend all the time in these virtual worlds.
It's just better like in reality.
So, until now, in the collectively World of Warcraft has spent 5.93 million years to solve the virtual issues of the Azero virtual problems.
Now, that's not necessarily one thing.
It could sound like a bad thing.
But I'll put this in context: 5.93 million years ago was the moment in which our first ancestors in the legs.
That's the first first one that was in the legs.
Okay, so when we're talking about how long we're using games, the only way we're going to talk about the magnitude of human evolution, which is a great thing.
But it's also it. Because it turns out that through the spending so much time playing games, we're actually able to do as human beings.
We're evolving to a more collaborative and heart.
That's true. That's what I think.
So, you take it into this interesting statistics.
It was published by a researcher at the Carnegie Mellon University.
Media person's young people's today from a powerful culture is going to have spent 10,000 hours playing online games to age 21.
Now, 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of two reasons.
First of all, for children in the United States 10.080 hours is the number of hours that you're going to spend in school school in the fifth grade and until you're finding high school.
So we've got a parallel of education that's happening in which the young people learn as much about what the rest of the rest in school.
And some of you probably read the new book of Malcom Gladwell, called Outliers.
So, you're going to be heard the theory of the 10,000 success theory.
It's based on the acease research on the cognitive field, that if we can resist 10,000 hours of hard study study, to any 21-year-old, we're going to be specialists on that subject.
We're going to be as good as the largest personalities in the world.
And so what we're looking at now is a whole generation of young people who are specialized players.
So, the big question is, "What are they getting so good players?"
Because, if we could figure that, we had a human resource practical resource.
Here's how many people have now in the world that's happening at least a day playing online games.
These are our gamers.
500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something.
And in the next next decade, we're going to have another billion players that are good at anything.
If you don't know, it comes.
Industry games develop the consoles that make a little energy on the basis of energy, and they're working on the Internet networks in the Internet of band so that the gamers all over the world, China, Brazil, you can online.
They estimate one another billion gamers in the next decade.
This is going to 1.5 billion players.
So I started thinking about what these experts are doing these experiments.
These are the four things that we've discovered. The first is urban optimism.
OK. Think about that as an internal motivation.
Optimism is the desire to act immediately in the face of a obstacle, combined with belief that we have a resonable opportunity to success.
The God always believed that a win a win win is possible, and they're always worth to try, and it's worth now.
Jucers didn't sit down.
The Gamers are experts at the tea of a powerful social tissue.
There's a lot of studies that show that we like people like a lot of people like a lot of people like them, even if they're beating amarnic.
And the reason is that it's very much trust to play a game with someone.
We think that someone will spend that time with us, that's going to play after the same rules, they'll play after the same thing.
And so, playing a game with someone really built up and trust and cooperation.
And as a result, we build more powerful social relationships.
Productivity. I love this.
You know, there's a reason why the World of Warcraft is playing 22 hours a week, think about a partial job.
It's because you know, when we're playing a game, that we're even happier with friends.
We know that we are optimized as human beings to make heavy work and full of sense.
And the players are willing to work on all the time, if you leave their work.
Anyway, epic.
Jucers love to be attached of the missions that inspiring stories of the planet.
So just a little trivia to help us see things in perspective.
So, we all know Wikipedia, the largest wiki in the world.
The second largest wiki, with almost 80,000 articles is the World of Warcraft.
Five millions of people use it every month.
They've compiling more information about the World of Warcraft through the Internet than any other wiki in the world.
They're building a story.
They're making a power of knowledge about the World of Warcraft.
Okay, so we have this four super power that's somehow about one thing.
The Gamers are strong individuals and full of hope.
They're people who believe are individually able to change the world.
And the only problem is that they think they're able to change the virtual worlds, but not the real world.
This is the problem I'm trying to solve.
It's an economist called Edward Castronova.
His is genial. He studies why people invest so much time and energy and money in virtual worlds.
And he says, "We're great at what's concreation's nothing less than a great mass exod in the game of virtual worlds."
: He's a economist. So it's rational.
And he says, "Not like me -- I'm a game designer, and I'm exuberant.
But he says, that's a clear sense, because players can get more in online than they can achieve lives.
They can have more powerful social relationships in real lives.
They get better fedback and feel worse in games than in real life.
So he's saying that, it's got a sense for players to spend more time in virtual worlds than in real world.
Now, I'm going to agree that's rational, for the moment.
But it's not in any case, an optimal situation.
We need to start doing the real world more like a game.
So, I'm my inspiration from something that happened 2,500 years ago.
These are angry ares, of the bones of a hour. Right?
Before he had extraordinarily embarrassing, I had bone bones.
And these are the first game equipment created by human beings.
And if you're familiar with the work history of Herodot, you may know this story.
What's the history of the games and why.
Herodot said that games, and they've been in particular games, were invented in the Lydie at a moment of hunger.
Aparent, it was such a big hunger that the Lydia had to do something crazy.
People southern people.
It was an extreme situation. They needed an extreme solution.
So, "Herodot, they've invented the games and they define a valuable policy in the whole king.
And one day, every one of them will eat.
And the next day, everybody's going to play.
And it's going to be that focused on the games, because games are so solicitors, and they're learning in a productivity so satisfying that they would ignore that they didn't have food.
And so in the day they were playing, and you're going to eat.
And by Herodotus, they've lived 18 years, surviving a day and play in a day and playing games on the other.
Now, that's exactly, I think, the way we use games today.
We use games to get rid of the real world.
We use games to run out of all the things that is stricted in real environmental environment, everything that's not been satisfied by our lives, and we get what we need in games.
But it doesn't have to be here.
That's really interesting.
By's saying Herodot, after 18 years the hunger wouldn't attention.
And so the regard decided that they'll play a game ultim.
They've divided the entire regarded in two.
They've played a zars game, and the winners had received to go into an adventure.
They will leave Lydia.
And they're going to look for a new place in which to live, lead the right so people to survive with little resources that were more available, and hopefully, hopefully to drive the civilization somewhere else can thrive.
Now, that sounds crazy, isn't it?
But recently, you evidence the DNA has shown that the Roman of Roman, they had the same DNA as and the old Lydia.
And so the scientists suggested that Herodot could be true.
And the geologists have found evidence of a global warmed for about 20 years, and that would have been able to explain the hunger.
So, this crazy story could be true.
They could actually save their culture plays, playing games, to get through the games for 18 years, and then to be so inspired and to know so many of them to be able to know by games that they actually saved the whole civilization.
OK, we can do that.
We play Warcraft in 1994.
That's the first game was in the World of Warcraft. That was 16 years ago.
They played games for 18 years, we've played Warcraft for 16.
I say that we're ready now for our own game.
Now they've got half civilization that left to look for a new world.
So, here's my 21 billion hours of play a week.
Let's get half of us to get half of us to play a half hour day to play a half hour video game games until we solve real lives.
Now, I know you're asking you, "How can we solve real life problems in games?" "Well, that's the theme that I've done the work over the last few years, at the Institute for Viitor.
We have this banner to our offices in Palo Alto and express our opinion of how to try we're trying to relate with the future.
We don't want to try to predict the future.
What we want to do is to create the future.
We want to imagine the best scenario.
And then we want to keep people this scenario in reality.
We're going to imagine wisdom and then give people people people to get these eepy wins.
I want to show you very short about three of the games that we've done that they've done that try to give people the means to create epy wins in their own future.
So, that's the Lea Fno Petrol.
I created this game in 2007.
This is an online game where you're trying to survive a oil crisis.
The oil is fictive, but I got enough content there so you can think it's real, and I've got there so you can think it's real life as we didn't have oil. So when you're living.
And then we're transmissions in real survey that it shows you exactly how much the oil costs, which is not available, how it's not available, how it's affected, if they're the transportation, if they are protests.
And you have to imagine how you're living with your life if all of those would be true. And then we're asked to write about it, to publish movies, to publish films.
I tested this game in 2007 with 1700 players.
And I was three years old.
And I can tell you that it's a experience that makes you.
Nobody wants to have their own life just because it's good for the world, or because that's right for the world, or because that's the world's good for the world, because it's good at all.
But if you include them in an adventure, and you say, "We're going to remain oil."
This is a story and a fantastic adventure where to push you.
Let's challenge you in seeing how you're surviving.
Most our toys our players had supported their habits that they taught in this game.
So for the future game future that could save the world, we decided to keep in problems, more than the oil.
AM created a game called Superstruct at the Institute for Viitor.
And the premise was that a supercomputer supercomputer was that people only have 23 years of spent on this planet.
Supercomputer is called the Global Extinction of itself, of course.
I asked people to come online almost as a movie by Jerry Bruckheimer.
You know the movies of Jerry Bruckheimer's films.
You're the astronomer, the scientist, the footon prisoner, and they all have something to do to slave the world.
But in our game, instead of having only five people in this dreams of dream, and I said that everybody's part of the dream, and it's your job, and it's the future food, the future of security and safety.
AM had 8,000 people who played this game for eight weeks.
They've invented 500 the creative solutions that you can see if you go online and search, "Souperstruct" on Google.
So, finally, the last game we're launch in three march. This is a game created in collaboration with the Bancar Institute, if you can fill the game of the Global Institute, you're going to be certified by the World Bank.
And working with university of all sub-Saharan Africa and they inviting social innovation.
We have a novel. We've got an increase in the attributes like local intuition, social intuition, which is supposed to address, vision and the capacity of being supplied resources.
I'd like to invite you all of you to share this game with the young people anywhere in the world, especially in the developing areas that could benefit from meeting to try and start to turn their own social companies that save the world.
So, now I'm going to summarize.
I want to ask you something.
What do you think it's going to happen now?
We've got all these amazing players, we have these games that are a kind of pilot of what we could do, but one of those didn't save the world.
Well, I hope you're going to agree with me that players are a human resource that we can use to work for the real world, that games are a powerful platform.
We all have these amazing superpowers, happy productivity, the ability to keep a solidance of social relationships, this sense of optimism, and the desire to have an urgent sense of urgent optimism.
I hope from the soul that we can put us to play games that matter, to survive on this planet for another century.
And it's my hope you join to create and play games like this.
When I'm thinking about the next decade, I know two things that we can certainly create any future that we can play it, and that we can play anything we want.
So, I'm going to start games that change the world.
Thank you.
For some time I'm interested in the placebo effect, which would seem weird for a magician, just if you think about it, and that's what I thought, "something that's real."
Otherwise said, the pills have a measurable effect in some ways of studies, the effect, just because the person who thinks that what's going on is a pharmacekeeping effect, or something like that...
For instance, for example, if it's believed, in the body has a measurable effect called the placebo effect.
Something's something real because of the ways that someone perceived.
In order to tell us, I want to start by showing you a rudent trick, a very simple trick.
And I'm going to show you how it works. That's a trick that you find in every book of the 1950.
And I learned it from Cub Scout Magic in 1970.
I'm going to show you and then I'm going to explain it.
And then I'm going to explain why I explain.
So, here's what's going on.
The price, which you can examine; my hand, you can see it.
I'm going to keep it like this.
I'm going to get your hand.
And in order to make sure you don't come out of my hand, I'm going to raise out here.
To see that there's nothing around here.
And as they've been there's don't come out of my hand.
And it's pretty simple.
I'm going to open your hand, and I hope, if it's all that's my magic animal is just going to support the cute.
It's actually that's so well that I can excuse your hand, and the cutting.
It doesn't look at all of your hand, no plate. And you can examine everything.
Two!
And they often teach the children's this body's in the magic, because you can learn a lot about however, and it's very simple to do.
Probably many of those here are already here.
Here's what's going on.
It's in your hand.
And I say, I'm going to keep my hand to make sure I don't go on there, it's a lie.
The reason for me I'm going on the secret of this illusion.
At the moment, my hand is moving out of the dvs, and you don't see it, that's going to move from a position.
Hi.
There is a child without childhood.
So, that's how it works, right here.
And as I hate me, my finger is moving the position.
And we can talk about why I'm going to do this in error, why you don't you notice that I'm just processes information, not named one, two, three thanks. They clean them.
But that's not everything. Isn't it? And then I open your hand.
Now, of course, the cutting is in there, not by magnetism, but through a trick, it's my shot.
And then when I close up, the same thing, the same thing, as I'm getting back, the movement in a way of my finger.
I'm my hand. And the cutting.
That's what you can do your friends and neighbors. Merand.
Now, what's the linking effect?
I read a year ago, and a year ago, who opened me up my mind.
So I'm not even a scientist, so for me, this was amazing.
It turns out that if you add a placebo pilot in the form of a white pile, just a white pile, it's just a white pile, has a certain effect.
But if you change the shape in which you give, you a smaller pills, you're a smaller, you're making blue and you're on it a letter.
Although one of these pills don't have pharmaceutical substance.
But the white pills is not as good as the blue.
How? This left left me.
And yet it turns out that it doesn't stop here.
If you take the sules, they're more efficient than the tablets, in any form.
A colored sule, the yellow in a end and the other is better than the white capsule capsule.
And with the evidence is a thing.
A twice a day twice a day, it's not as good job -- I don't remember the research now. Sorry.
But the idea is that...
... and the dozen matters.
And even the shape has something to do with it.
And if you're going to get the raising effect, you have to get the needle.
Yes? An's something inertable -- a few centimeters of something inert, and you injects this into a patient --
So it's a very powerful picture for them, much stronger than the white pile.
It's real, this graph, well, I'm going to show you another time.
The idea is that the white pile is not as good blue as the blue as the blue as a capsule, and it's not as good as a needle.
And no real pharmaceutical quality.
Our only trust our body makes it real body in our body and produces a stronger effect.
And I wanted to see if I could apply this idea to a magic trick.
And they take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it real.
And we know the study that if you want reality, you have to use the act.
That's a seats of seven countries. It's very ascud. It's very hit.
And I'm going to sterilize it.
That's my hand. It's nothing artificial.
This is my skin. It's not a special effect of Hollywood.
I'm going to get the skin, and I'm going to get it.
If you're sensitive -- if you're slightly -- we were doing this for a few friends in the hotel room, and there were some people I don't know, and a woman who I don't know, and a woman who I don't know, and a woman's almost leverage.
So, I'm going to suggest that if you can make it's bad to look at another part in the next matter -- you know what, you know, I'm not going to do the first part of view.
You're going to see, you'll forget in another part if you want.
So that's, right here, in this part of my arm to the bottom of my arm, I'm going to do a small hole.
I'm sorry. Tues?
And now I'm going through the skin, and I get the other way.
Now, we're kind of at the same dot.
That's something.
But now you can't count my fingers, right?
Well, let's show you. Watch one, two, three, four, five.
Yeah, well...
I know what people think when I see that.
I'm saying, "Well, it's not so bad that they're going to take a few minutes.
What does that look like? That's good.
Yes, I know. And the back will say, "OK. I actually didn't see that," OK. "
Let me show you better.
That's my skin. It's not a special effect from Hollywood.
That's my carnose, and I can do it.
I'm sorry. If you're bad, look at the other side, you don't look at that.
Those of the back or those who will look at the video record will say, "It's," Oh, well, it's pretty curated -- if they'd have a hole there and another, if they'd be real, it would be bleed, "Let'd be doing some gap.
Gata, here.
Now, normally, I'm going to get the act.
I wouldn't make your hand, and I wouldn't do it.
But I think in this context, and the idea of taking something fake and turn it into something real, I'm going to turn it out there, and I'm going to leave the stage.
We're seeing a few times.
I hope you're just waiting. Thank you very much.
So I knew a lot of fish at my life.
I just loved two.
The first was more like a passionate business.
It was a nice fish, full of gust, with texture, books, a menu state.
What fish.
Even better, it's been raised at a farm, it seems, the highest standards of sustainability.
So you could feel good when you sell it.
I've been in a relationship with this beauty for more months.
And one day, the director of her company called me, and he asked me if I'd talk to a event about sustainability.
"Of course, I said.
Here's a company trying to solve what this has become this unimagined for our kindness.
How do we keep the cave?
For the last 50 years, I've been fishing in the sets and the oceans like we're decolred.
It's hard to overcome.
90 percent of the fish, the one we love, the one that we love, the tone, the sabove, the sabsolute fish, the sabove.
They've been disappeared.
So, at good or bad, the acvacuum, fighting farm, get a part of our future.
There's a lot of controvers.
It's fish pollution, at least most of them do it, and they have reduced productivity, see the ton.
It's a major deficiency.
It's got a conversation of 15 feeding one.
That means that it takes 15 pounds of wild fish to achieve a ton delivering ground.
It's not too sustainable.
And it doesn't have the taste too.
So here, finally, it was a company that was trying to do well.
I wanted to support them.
The day before the event we called the public relationships in the company.
Let's call it Don.
"Don", I said, "just to put things at the point, you're going to be the west because you're growing fish, you don't pollution."
"Right," he said, "We're so far on our waste, that the waste from our fish are diluated, they're not focused."
And then he added, "We're actually a new world.
The conversation of food? 2.5 to one, "he said.
"The best on the market."
2.5 to one, great.
"2.5 to one of what? What's food?"
"Proters sustainable," he said.
"Grozav," I said. "
And in that night, I was steal in the bed and I was thinking, what the hell is a sustainable protein?
So the second day, even before the event, I called the Don.
I said, "Don, give me some examples of sustainable proteins," He said he didn't know. It's going to be like.
Well, I've been talking to a few people in the company.
No one could not give me a clear response.
And finally, I talked to the chief biologist.
Let's call him Don.
"Don," I said, "give me some examples of sustainable proteins," Well, he mentioned a little bit of fish.
I said, "Well, do you know?"
He said, "Mda," yes, "bones," Oh, "
I said, "What's in your food?"
And thinking, you understand me, at about two percent.
"Well, it's about 30 percent," he said.
"Don, what's sustainable in feeding the fish?" "I said.
It was a long break on the line, and he said, "It's just a lot of the world."
My love for this fish was wrong.
No, because I would be a virtuous thought of virtuous and hypocrit.
In fact, they're really.
No, I felt wrong by this fish, because, I'm going to God, after that conversation, after that conversation, the fish had gust of chicken.
The second fish, is another kind of love story.
It's the romantic, the kind of like that, the best you know, the fish you love it.
I was eating him at a restaurant in the southern Spain.
A journalist, a journalist was talking about this fish.
So in a way that meeting us meeting.
She came to the table in a blue, lit.
Bucoked him too much.
That's about twice.
It's still a delicious, though.
Who can make that fish the good taste after it was cooking too much?
I can't, but this guy can't.
Let's call it Miguel.
In fact, his name is even Miguel.
And no, he didn't find the fish, and he's not a chief.
At least it doesn't the way you and I understand that.
He's a biologist to VetLa Palma.
It's a farming farm in the Spania.
It's at the ship of the Guadalquivir.
By the's 1980s was in the hands.
They increase in the area that was actually a slap.
They've created it as the land.
They've built this series of complicated channels, and they pushed the water outside the area, back in the river.
But they couldn't get it to work economic.
And ecological was a disaster.
He killed 90 percent of the birds, which for this place is a lot of birds.
So in 1982 a Spanel company, with ecological consciousness.
What did they do?
They reversed the short meaning of water.
They've done my own.
Instead of pushing the water out, they used the channels to bring water back.
They've gone.
They've created a 1,000 hectare 1,000 hectare -- biban, baby, baby, baby, baby, and in this Miguel, and his company, they have completely affects the ecological effects of our ecology.
The Ferma is incredible.
I mean you wouldn't see something like that.
You've got choleen at the horizont millions of miles, and all you see are unfound channels and land, often.
I was there with Miguel.
He's a great guy, three parts of Charles Darwin and part Crocodile.
All right? Here's right? Here's heavy, and I'm hoping and transpir, and Miguel, and Miguel of keeping the biology.
Here's a gray of gray shoulders.
It's the need mineral needs of phitoplankton.
And here he sees a pattern in the group that reminds them of the tanzanian.
I learned that Migel had spent most career in the National Park of Mikumi Park of National Park of Africa.
And I wondered how it became such an expert in fish.
He said, "Well, we knew nothing about fish.
I'm expert in relationships. "
And then they're launching in many discussions of rare and algay plants.
And you don't understand me wrong, it was really fascinating, you know, a kind of biotics community in directly.
It was great, but I was really nice.
And I was a leg after that piece of dolphin fish piece of fish, which I consumed in the previous evening.
So I said, "Miguel," Miguel, "What does your fish?"
He showed up to another.
"Yes, I know, the algc, phitoplankton, phitoplankton, the relationships, is amazing.
What about your fish?
What is the conversation rate of food? "
Well, he started telling me that it's a kind of rich system, that fish eats would be eating and in the wild.
The Biomass plants, phitoplankton, the fish, the feeds.
The system is so healthy, it's so healthy.
It's not necessary.
Have you ever heard of a farm who don't feed the animals?
Later in that day, I'd drive through this car property, and I said, "Well, I said," For a place that looks like natural, "unlike anything else."
At that point, it was like the king movie would be asked to change the decore of the decore.
And I gave the cold, and I saw the most amazing view, thousands and thousands of birds and thousands and thousands of birds of pink flamingo, a truly cover, a truly covering.
"This is the success," he said.
"Look at their strengths.
It looks like, "
"I was completely unSunday.
I said, "The Miguel, but they don't it in your fish?"
"Yes," he said him.
"We're 20 percent of our fish and the fish caves to the fish.
Well, last year, this property had 600,000 birds on it, more than 250 different species.
Today became the largest and one of the most important sanctuary birds from all of Europe. "
Now, I said, "Miguel, I'm a flourishing population is not the last thing you want to have a fish farm?"
He clapping his head, not.
He said, "We're making extensively, not intensive.
This is an ecological network.
The flamingo measures.
The crew is eating phitoplankton.
So the more roz is, the better the system. It's the system. "
All right, let's recapitulate.
A farm that doesn't feeding their animals, and a farm that measuring their success by its own good animals.
A fish fish, but it's a bird sanctuary.
Oh, by the way, those flamingo birds, they shouldn't be there.
They're locking in a city at 240 kilometers distance, where the soil conditions are better to build the waste.
In every morning, her 240 kilometers to the farm.
And every night, they fly 240 kilometers back.
They do it because they're able to track the white line of the A92.
It's not a joke.
I've been imagining something like this, so I looked at Miguel.
I said, "Miguel, they fly 240 kilometers at the farm, and then they fly 240 kilometers back night?
I'm doing this for their pups? "
He looked at me as a Whitney Houston Whitney Houston.
He said, "No."
I didn't mentioned my love, who was delicious, and I don't like fish skin.
I don't like a toaster.
It's got that unplease, as gudron.
When I cook, I'm going to get it almost every time.
However, when I gusted it to that restaurant from the Spain, he didn't have taken at all of fish skin.
He had a dulce and curated as if you took a muscle of the ocean.
I mentioned this Miguel and enjoy.
He said, "The Piel acts as a budget.
It's the last defense of anything that goes into the body.
He's evolved to absorb impurities. "
And then he added, "But our water doesn't have impurities."
All right. A farm that doesn't feed the fish.
A farms that measuring their own success by the animal success.
And then I understood when he said, a farm who doesn't have impurities, he's got a long time, because the water that goes through the farm Guadalquivir comes from the River Guadalquivir.
It's a river that bringing with it all the things that I'm going to bring with all of the things that I've got all of the things that I'm getting a laughing.
And when he does it drum through the system, it's clean it, the water is clean than the entry.
The system is so healthy that he's so healthy that the water.
So, not just a farm that doesn't feeds the animals, not just a farm that measure their success through our health care, but a farm that's even a fishing of water, and not only for those fish, but for me too.
Because when water goes, she goes back into the Atlantic Ocean.
A painting in the ocean, I know, but they take it to consider, and that's so you should do, and that's how you should do, and that's also instructive.
You might say, it's a recipe for the future food, no matter what we're talking about biban or see.
What we need now is a radical concept of agriculture, one where food actually actually has good.
But for a lot of people this is a little too radical.
We're not realistic.
We are love.
We love markets.
We love little families.
We're talking about local food.
We eat organic.
And when you suggested that these are things that will ensure the future food, someone somewhere get up and say, "Hey, and I love birds," Hey, and I love birds, but how are you going to feed the world?
How do you feed the world? "
Can I be honest?
I don't like that.
No, it's not because we're producing more than we need for the world.
A billion people are going to be a few people today.
A billion -- that's more than ever before -- because of the great inequality of great inequality.
Now, I don't like this question, because it driven our food system for the last 50 years.
Hitches yesterday with gray, treats monocultures, chemicals bags in the soil, it gives you the fish, and all of the business ags, and all the business agrare, "How bad can we be if we didn't have any more people with less money?"
That was the motivation.
It was justification.
The plan of American agriculture.
We should tell it, a business, a business in liquid, a business that's ecology, a business which is making that possible production.
This is not a business, and it's not agriculture.
Our bread is threatened today, not because of the properties, because of the resources, not by invention of the last tractor, not by invention of the last tractor, not pump, but of the fertilizer water, not pump, but lack of the fights, not to forests and not to forests, not by hopes, and not by hot,
Do you want to feed the world?
So let's start wondering, how are we going to feed ourselves?
Or better, how can we create the conditions that allow each communities to feed itself?
In order to do that, don't look at the agricultural business in the future.
It's very old and it's hot.
I've got a lot of capital, chemistry and cars, and it didn't ever product.
Instead of that, look at the ecological model.
This is the one that's based on billions of years of work.
Look at Miguel, farmers like Miguel, farmers who are not just worlds for themselves, which are not just worlds for themselves, the farms that cultive instead of extensive, the farmers that are not just producers, but the experts that are not just producers, because they're the expertise, because they're the experts.
And if I really want to be a bad chief than I'll be better than I'm ever going to be.
You know, I'm doing this, because if that's the future food, she's going to be delicious.
Thank you.
I grew up with a constant Science Fiction.
At high school, I was walking with the bus to school as a hour, and one return into every day.
And I was always absorbit of a book, scientifically book, a scientifically book, what was worry about other worlds and satisfying me, in a narative form of curiosity that I had.
And -- you know -- that curiosity is also manifestate in the fact that anytime I was not at school, I was outside, through the forests, walking and college, "samples," samples, "broastery and beetles, helping them back, and we put them back into the microscope.
I was a truly nerd in the science.
But everything had to do with my attempt to understand the limits of the way.
And my scientifically scientifically, it seemed to be in the world around me, because of what's happening -- that's going on, because of what's happening -- I was going to explore the deep of the oceans.
Jacques Cousteau came to our own fragments with the amazing special emissions that showed us animals, and in a fantastic world that we couldn't imagine before.
So, that seemed to the whole scientifical part.
And I was an artist.
I was able to draw. I could draw the paint.
And I discovered that, because there were no video games and respective this saturation saturation, and all this full of images in my head, I had to create these images in my head.
You know, we've all had, as children have to read a book and, through the description of the author, to put something on the theater screen of our headlines.
And so, my answer to all of this is to draw, paint creatures and extratererre-world, robots, robots, space, all of these things.
I'm always caught on the house.
That's because this creativity was supposed to find, somehow, a way of embrace.
And it was a very interesting thing, Jacques Cacques Cousteau made me really excited about the fact that there was a foreign world, exiented, right here on Earth.
I couldn't really work in an extratererrer world, in a space spacecraft.
This dream looks pretty unrealist.
But that's a world where we could really go here, right here, on Earth, and that's the Earth, and that's like anything I've imagined those books.
So I decided I was going to become a diving at the age of 15.
And the only problem with this was that I lived in a small room in Canada, at 600 miles away away from the closest ocean ocean.
But I didn't really leave this.
I pissed my dad until she found, in my dad until she found, in Buffalo, New York, just near the border, almost from where we lived.
And I've actually become certified in a cat in YMCA in the mid of winter in the middle of winter in Buffalo, New York.
And I didn't see the ocean, a real ocean, for two years, when we moved to California.
Since then, in the course of 40 years, I've spent about 3,000 hours underwater and 500 hours have been in those water.
And we learned that the deep environment of the ocean, and even deeper oceans a little deep, they're so full of life, that we can imagine.
The imagination of nature's so lack of limits, compared to our human imagination.
I'm completely amazed about what I see when they're doing these diving.
And my story of love with the ocean continues, and it's as powerful as it was always.
But when I chose a career, as adult, like adult, that's been register.
And this thought of being the best way to fold this need to tell stories with the need to create images.
And in childhood, I'd draw comics, and so on.
So, the movies was the way of putting the images and the stories together. And that's meaning.
And of course, the stories I chosen to tell were the scientifical stories: "" "" "" "" "" and "Aben."
And with "The" in "I", "I" I've been, "
By these two passions.
Something interesting to come from "The Abbison" which is to solve a specific problem of that movie, which is the creation of high fires of water, which we embarrassed animation, CG.
And this led to the first character that came out in a movie.
And even though the movie didn't make money, I should just say that he had just won the investment, I was march to something extraordinary, which is that the audience, the global audience, it was hipnotied by this magic apparenting.
You know, it's the law enunced by Arthur that any advanced technology is impossible to distance.
They saw something magical.
And so, that made me become very excited.
And I thought, "Wow, that's something that's got to be adopted in the theater art."
That's why, in "Terminator 2," which was my next movie, I took that much further.
And working with ILM, we've created the individual from the liquid metal from that movie, the success of how this particular effect.
And it worked. And we created again.
And we had the same result with the audience.
And I did something more money from the end of this.
So, I'm living a link between these two experiences, has the fact that this is going to be a completely new world, a new form of creativity for film artists.
In conclusion, I put the based on a company with Stan Winston, my good friend Stan Winston, who is the creatures and costumes at that time, and I called the Digital Domain.
And the idea behind her company was that we're going to jump the analogical processes of optics, and so on, and so on and we're going to go directly into the digital production.
And we actually did that, which has given us a competitive advantage for a while.
But I '90s in terms of the' 90s in terms of design, and the character, and the character, which the company was the funny company.
And I wrote this piece called "Avatar," who had the role to pushing things out in terms of the visual effects, the graphy effects, the computer graphics and more, with human characters in CG.
And the main character was going to be completely generated in CG.
And the world was going to be all CG.
But plans didn't work.
And people from my company, they told me that we wouldn't do that for a while.
So, I put the idea at the forest, and we made another movie about a big boat that sea diving.
You know, I went and introduced it to the studio like "Romeo and Julieta on a ship."
I'm going to be a romantic story, a passionate movie.
In secret, what I wanted to do was to make me exfund to the real ethail of Titanico.
And that's why I did the movie.
This is the truth. Well, the studio didn't know that.
But I convinced them. I told you, "We're going to dive. We're going to make good.
We're going to use this at the beginning of the film.
It will be very important. It's going to be an excellent to marketing. "
And I convinced them to fund an expedition.
It sounds crazy. But it's about that imagination can create a reality.
Because we've actually created a reality in which six months later, I find me in a submarine, I'm looking at the truth of the North Atlantic Titanic printing through a huh, not a movie, not on the movie, not on the movie.
Now, this fascinated me.
And it took a lot of prepared, we had to build cameras, and all sorts of things like this, but amazed to me how much diving, this deep background, this deep background was like a space mission.
You know, where everything was powerful technologized, and it's a lot of planning.
In this capsule, you look at this dark environment, you can't waiting for this dark environment, if you can't return.
And I thought, "Wow. They're living in a science fiction movie.
This is really cool. "
And that's what I was really cutting in the deep exploration of the oceans.
Of course, curiosity, of course.
It was all the adventure, it was curiosity. It was curiosity. It was a imagination.
And it was a experience that Hollywood could not give me.
Because, you know, I could imagine a creature and I could create a visual effect, and I could create a visual effect for it. But I couldn't imagine what we're seeing through that hub.
While I was making some of the ultery expedition, we could see creatures at the hydrothermal ventilators, and sometimes things I've never seen, sometimes things that we've never seen, sometimes things that we could see, and we photographed them.
So, I was completely, and I had to have to have more.
So I made a pretty curious decision.
After Titanic-hit, I said, "I" I'm going to put a little bit of movies, and I'm going to get a lot. "
And so we began to pay these expeditions.
And we got to go to Bismark and explore it with robotic vehicles.
We went back to the Titanic ethy.
We took little robots that I would create on the optics, we're optics.
And the idea was to get inside, and to make an internal exploration of the nose, which has never done before.
Nobody has forgotten. They didn't have the means to do that, so we've done that, so we've created the technology to achieve this thing.
So, you know, here I'm the Titanic-head, in a submarine and looking at the bridge that't look at the bridge.
And I control a small robotic vehicle robotic vehicle through the nest.
When I say, I'm controlling it, but my mind is in that vehicle.
I felt like I was a physically physically presented in Titanic-hour.
And it was the worst of the commons that I've ever had, because I knew before I was going to get a corner of a corner that would be there, before the vehicle lights to reveal it, because I'm walking on stage, because I'd raising the movie.
And the scene was built as an exaction of the vapord plans.
This was a remarkable experience.
And it made me really realize the telepresent experience that you can have with these robotics, when your consciousness is injected in a vehicle, in this other form of existence.
It was deeply to a deep thing.
And maybe a short look at what might happen over a few decades, as we're going to start to have a body of cyborg for exploration or other purposes in many of the future types of post-human scientifically.
So, by doing these expeditions and starting to appreciate really appreciate what we've discovered there, down, like these reventies of the ocean, where we discovered these amazing animals.
They're essentially exhibit that live right here, on Earth.
They live in an environment of chemical synthesis I don't survive in a solar system based on sunlight, so we.
So you see animals that live in the water jets of water with temperatures of 500 degrees.
You're thinking they could not survive.
At the same time, I was very interested in the science of the space science of the science of space, the science that I've experienced in a childhood.
And I got involved in the community of those interested in the space community of the NASA, very involved with NASA, part of the NASA's consultal mission, going into Russia, and all of those things, and all these things, to truly, and all these things, to go to truly and all these things, in order to truly, and all these things out to the stuff to really is really star, and we we we we we we all these things to the space of space to the things to really stand all these things to actually go go go go go, to the space to the the space of space to the things, and all these things together together together together together together together with the highhighhighhigh-
And that was fascinating.
But what eventually I got to do is to bring people from the space of us.
And to lead them down because they have access, so that's what they're interested in the planet, people who were interested in these extreme environments, taking a deep and leading them to see and sampling them to test and take it to samples and so on.
So here's making us films, but we actually studied, we would create the science of space.
I finished completely the circle between being the science fiction of fantastic, you know, as a child, and to do these things on good. "And you know, in the course of this discovery, I learned a lot.
I've learned a lot about science. But I also learned a lot about the art of driving.
Now, you think that's got to be a leader, leader, leader, don't have to be a leader, and all of those things.
I didn't really learn about the art of driving until we didn't do these expeditions.
Because I had to, at some point, say, "What do I do here?
Why do I do this? What I'm doing this? "
We don't make money with these missions.
We're just surviving. I don't have any kind of famous.
People, I think I've left between Titanic "and" Avatar, "and" I made my angle somewhere, sit on the floor.
And we did all these movies, we did all these documentary documentary for a very limited audience.
Without famous, no glory, no glory, no money. What do you do?
You're doing it for work, for challenging -- and the ocean is the most challenge that exists, for the emotion of discoveries and the strania connects that are made when a small group of people are making a team to make a single team.
Because we did these things with a 10-12 team, working for years.
Sometimes [being] on the big for 2-three months.
And in this connection, you realize that the most important thing is that you've got for them, and they've done for you, you've done a job that you can't explain somebody else.
When you come back to the country and you say, "We had to do that, and the fiber optics, and that's all the technology, and that's all the technology that's been involved, and it's all the technology. It's the thing that can tell him, and they're talking about it, and you can"
That's about it, creating a connection.
So when I went back to make my next movie, who was "Avatar," I "I tried to apply the same principle of drives, and that's what the equipment.
And it really changed the dynamics.
Here's me again with a team, unknown territory, unknown territory, making "Avatar" Avatar. "
There's interesting.
There's a challenge.
And I became a family, on the course of a four and a half years.
And that's changed with my movies.
So people have commented the asubra of way that, well, you know, you've brought to the ocean organisms and put it on the Pandora.
For me, it was more a fundamental way of doing business, the process itself, which has changed as a result of this.
So, what can we take the synthesis of that?
You know, what the lessons are they learning?
Well, I think the first thing is curiosity.
It's the most powerful thing you have.
The imagination is a force that can truly in a reality.
And the team respect is more important than all the laws in the world.
The teachers come to me and say, "Give me a advice to do that."
And I say, "Don't your limit on you.
Other people will do that for you, they don't do it alone, not pary.
And hide your risks. "
NASA has phrase this phrase. "
But the failure has to be an option in art and exploration, because it's a matter of trust.
And not an important attempt to ask for innovation, it didn't be done.
You have to be willing to take those risks.
So, that's the thought I'm going to leave you, that you're failing with, you.
I'm going to leave you with a single important idea today, which is that the whole amount of data that we're consuming is bigger than the suits, and instead of thinking of the survey of information, I'm going to think about the way we can use information so that we can use data so that that could be invisible.
Now we're looking at a common graph of the mortality of organized mortality after the age.
The project that I use here is experimental, is called Pivot, and what I can do with it is that I can do with him is that I can filter a certain causes of death, accident.
I see how a different structure appeared, different.
That's because, here in the middle, people are in their most active period, and here because they're getting very fragile.
We're a step back, and we're taking death, we see that diseases circulators and cancer are the main suspects, but not all of all.
If we continue and we're filter after the age, we're going to say, 40 or less, we can see the accident are actually the most frequencies that are actually the most frequently the most frequency of people.
And further, it's the case for men.
You understand that this kind of visualization of data, it's as if you're swimming in a graph of living information.
And if we can do that with simple data, why don't we do the same with the content?
Here's the cover of every number of Sports Illustrated that has printed before.
They're all here. They're all on the Internet.
You can try this home when you leave here.
With Pivot, you can look at some time.
And then some years.
You can go directly to a particular subject.
I'm looking at this -- I'm looking at that -- I'm looking at that -- I'm looking at this -- I'm looking at this -- I'm looking at this -- I'm looking at.
I'm great fan Lance Armstrong, so I'm going to selected it, and this bringing me.
If I just want to look at them, maybe I'm going to see what they're going to see what they're talking about cycle in general? "
I go back and open that.
I see Greg Lemond now.
And you understand that when you sick through this information in this way, when you're going back and you don't read, you don't take.
You do something a little different.
It's somewhere in the middle, and we think it changes the way that can be used.
I want to go a little further on this idea that's a little song.
I took every page of Wikipedia, and I got it to a summary.
The shouldn't be a bridge and an icon that the field of where it comes.
I just show you the first 500 most popular page right here.
But even in this limited view, we can do a lot of things.
We see the subjects of the most popular on Wikipedia.
Now I'm going to select government.
Now, we chose governance, I can see the Wikipedia that corresponds the most frequently, and that's Time -- the Personality of the Anus.
And that's important because it's a thing that wasn't have a Wikipedia page page.
You can find this thing, just if you do a step back and look at all the simultaneously.
Now, looking at all of these particle sums, I can then explore more carefully the concept of the Time's magazine, to bring all of the surface.
And I'm looking at these people, I see most of the governments.
A few people come from natural science.
A few, and fewer come from business.
Here's my head.
And that comes from music.
And it's pretty interesting, Bono is a winner TED prize.
So we're going to look at the Prize winners.
You see, we're navigating for the first time the website, and not from the page in the page, but at a higher abstring level of abstring.
And I'm going to show you one thing to take you through your surprise.
I'm the New York Times.
Pivot, our application -- I don't want to call the browser, because it's not even a browser, but you can see the web page with it -- and we use the small scale in every page.
I can make a step back, to me back to a certain section.
What's important, because just accessing the Web pages in this way, I can see my whole search history in the same way.
I can explore in the detail that I've done in a lot of different time.
Here's the situation of this demo that we're doing right now.
And I can look at the stuff I've done today.
And if I want to make a step back and look at all, I can look at the history of search, for example.
Here I was looking for Bing, here for Labs Pivot.
And here I can choose a page and please again.
It's a reused metaphor more, and every case it makes the whole bigger than the sum of the parts of the data.
Now, in our world, we believe that data are a blatheast for us.
We're complaining about the path of the surface with information.
We say that we're in the data.
What if we'd come back, and we're going back, and the website, so we're going to move from one thing to the next thing, we're going to be able to find the patterns that otherwise are?
If we did that, instead of being caught in the heads, we could actually extract information.
And instead of having just a primary relationship with information, we could actually extract knowledge.
And if we're knowledge, maybe it's wisdom.
That, thank you.
Everybody talks about happiness today.
And I asked someone to numbers how many books they have the word "happiness," in the title have been published over the last five years and gave up after about 40. There are much more.
There's a val huge interest for happiness among researchers.
There's a lot of counseling happiness.
Everybody wants to make people happier.
But despite the numerous activities in this field, there's some cognitive capcans that are keeping us to make a clear picture about happiness.
So my resentation today is going to do the main of these cognitive captures.
They're valuable at the ordinary people who think about their own happiness, and the researchers who studies the concept of happiness, it turns out that we're just as everyone else.
The first one of those capcans is to admit the complexity of happiness.
It turns out that the term "happiness" is not a word useful word because we use it to too many different things.
It's probably a specific sense of that we could restraight it, but generally, generally, we're going to have to give up this notion and adoption.
The second headlines is a confusion between experience and memory: in fact, a confusion between being happy and being thank in their own life, or being thank about their own life.
There's two very different concepts, they're hungry in the notion of happiness.
And the third confusion is the illusion of perception, the regretable that we can't think about any circumstances.
And that's a serious cognitive device.
We just don't do it.
I'd like to start with the example of a person who during a session of questions and answers to the end of a seminary assume to me.
He'd listen to a symphony and that was absolutely wonderful.
But at the village of the record, there was heard a terrible, and he add, quite affected, fairly, that the scaring his whole experience.
In fact, it's not the experience of the experience.
It's the experience.
It's about 20 minutes of wonderful music.
But they've been released at zero, because what was remapping was the memory.
The minister had been altered, and the memory was all keeping.
Now, I think this is we're probably walling us and others as an entities with a double self.
There's a real moment that remains in the present, and lives the present, and lives the present, able to remove the past, but essentially the present.
It's the present that they're taking the doctor.
Do you know, when the doctor ask, "Do you want when your doctor?"
On the other side, there are the memory of the memory, and the self of the memory of our life.
It's the thing that you're going to ask, "How did you feel at the last time?"
or "What was excursia in Albania?"
These are the two very different entities, the momentities of the memory and the confusion of them, and the confusion of them lead to the notion of happiness.
The memory of memory is a storyteller.
It's starting with the basic answer of our memory, it starts.
We don't tell the stories about when we're conscious.
Our memory tells us stories, more precise, what we're able to remember our lives are a story.
Let me start with an example.
There's an old study about patients who go through a painful experience.
I'm not in the details. It's not painful today, but it was painful in "90s.
The patients were asked to describe to his pain every 60 sec.
We have here two patients and their relationships.
The question is, "What's suffered a lot more?"
It's a very simple question.
Obviously, the patient B got more.
And his Colonoscopy took more, went through every minute of painting that he's gone through every minute, and the patient's even more.
But here's another question, "How did these patients"
And here's a surprise: Surprise is that the patient A patient remained with a lot more unplant about colonoscopious.
The memories of these colonoschildren have been different because of the crucial story of the story of the story is how it closed.
None of the relationships is not memorable or grander to one of them -- but one of them is obvious more unlike the other one.
And the most unplease was that pain was to end.
It's a bad story.
How do we know?
I wondered these people after colonoscopy, much later, as unplease was procedure.
In their memory, it's been much more unplease for the patient of B.
It's a direct conflict, between those momentum and the ones.
In the point of view of the experimental self, is that the patient B has suffered a lot more.
What we could do with the patient A, and we actually did the clinical experiments, which has worked, is to preol the patient colonoscopious about the patient's patient's going on without move it too much.
That's going to make patient, but slightly, much less than before.
If we do this about two minutes, the experience of the patient's the experience of the moment of the patient's patient's time, and we've got a better memory of its experience.
What's a story?
And it's valuable for the stories they provide the memory, but also for the stories that we invent the memory, but also the stories that we invent.
What's defines a story of the changes, moments and the end.
The paper is very, very important.
In this case, the end was determining.
Sines momentum are continuous life.
Do it have successive moments of living, and you wonder: What's going on with these moments?
And the answer is very simple.
They're lost forever.
Most moments of life -- and I'm calculated: the psychological presented, they're saying that it takes about three seconds.
It means that in a life we have about 600 million these moments.
In a month, we have about 600,000.
Most of them don't leave it.
Most of the memory are completely ignonored of the memory.
And yet, somehow we have the impression that we should matter, that what's going on in these moments of living is our life itself.
It's the finite resource we consume in our existence on the ground.
And the way we spend it should be relevant, but it's not the story that the story that the self is the story that the self of the memory of those memory of the memory of mind a forest.
So we have the memory of the memory and the momentum, which are distincts.
The biggest difference between them is the way it's processed the time.
It's from the point of view of the momentum, if you leave in the vacation and two weeks is the same as good as the first, covering two weeks is the better than a week.
It doesn't work for memory, it doesn't work.
For the memory, a two weeks is unsignificantly better than a vacation for a week because they don't add memories.
The story didn't change.
So, the time it's becoming the essential variable that distinguishing the memory of the momentum.
Durata has a reduced impact on the story.
The memory of memory doesn't just remember and tell stories.
It's actually taking decisions because, if a patient had, for example, the second colonoschildren with two surgies different surgery and decides that they're going to claim, the one is a little unplease, which is the thing that determines.
The experimental issues has nothing to say in this choice.
We don't actually choose between experiences, but between the memories of the experiences of experiences.
And even when we think about the future, we don't think about the future as a set of experiences.
We think about our future as an anticipate memories.
And essentially you can think of this, as a tirandom of the memory of the memory, and you can consider the memory of your memory, and you can consider the experimental self by experiences that don't need.
We feel that when we go to vacation, and that's what's happening very often, which is going to go into the vacation, in the service of memory.
And that's kind of hard to justify, I'm sorry.
I mean, as we consume our memories?
This is one of the things that explains the domination of the memory.
And when I'm thinking about this, I'm thinking about a vacation that I've spent in Antarctica a few years ago, who was clear the most beautiful vacation that I've had, and I think about it pretty much as I think about other vacations.
And we probably consumed the memories of that three weeks to say, for about 25 minutes in the last four years.
If I'd be open the white with the 600 pictures, I've spent another hour.
So we have a part, three weeks and three weeks on the other side, the one hour and a half hour.
There's a discrepancy.
I might be a little bit of a paper that I'm thinking about my memories, but even if you're consistent to me, but even if you're consuitable.
Why do we give that a lot of importance of memory by comparison with the experience?
So, I'd like to think about an experiment.
Imagine that your next vacation, you know that at the end of the vacation of all your pictures will be destroy, and that you're going to take a drug that you don't remember anything.
Do you pick the same vacation?
And if you choose another vacation, there is a conflict, there's a conflict between the experimental self, and you have to think about how to transform this conflict, and it's not happening because, if you take the time as criteria, you'll have a response.
And if you take remembered as criteria, you might have another answer.
Why do we choose we choose?
is a problem where we're facing with a choice between the experimental self, and the memory of memory.
The experiments and the memory of the memory are doing about two different happiness notions.
There are actually two happiness concepts that we can apply, one for every self.
So you can wonder: How happy is the experimental self?
And on the other side: How happy are the moments in the life's life's?
And they're all happy.
It's a pretty complicated process.
What are the emotions that can be measuring?
And by the way, we're now we're able to make a pretty well-being of experimental self about happiness self experimental synthesis of experimental synthesis that we're now to make a pretty well-connected idea of happiness self about happily happiness.
Instead, the happiness of memory, is a completely different thing.
It's not about how happy lives a person lives.
It's about how satisfied times is this person when he's thinking about his life.
It's a very different notion.
Who doesn't do the distinction between these notions, will compromise the study of happiness, and I believable the study of happiness, and I believable the study of happiness for a long way.
The distinction between happiness happiness self and satisfaction the memory of the memory was recognized in the last few years ago, and they're doing now the efforts to measure both separate.
The Gallup the Gallup makes a world opiny opinion in which more than half a million people have been asked about their lives and experiences.
And there were other similar effort.
So in the last few years, we have started learning some things about the two happiness types.
And I think the main lessons that we've taught, is the fact that they're really different.
You can know how happy they're some of their lives, and that's not a lot about how happiness they are in their lives, and grew.
Just to give you a correlation, the correlation is about 0.5, that's about 0.5, that's where you're saying, "Oh's 1,80 meters's a lot about the intimate of this person?
Well, you've got something about his inaltimate, but there's a lot of reuncertainty.
If you're looking at eight to say that someone evaluated at eight on a decade of your life, you've got a door of the experimental self.
So the correlation is the small.
We know something about what's controlling something about the satisfaction of happiness.
We know that money is really important, the goals are very important.
I know that happiness means rather than to be satisfactory with the people that we like, to spend time with people that we like.
There are other please, these are dominant.
So if you're going to measure the second happiness, you'll get to do different things.
The building on what we said is here is the fatphase as we actually shouldn't think about happiness as a substitute substitte for good.
It's a completely different notion.
Now, very quickly, another reason why we can't we can't think of happiness is that we don't think of the same things thinking about life and when we live.
So, if you're a simple question of how happy they're people in California don't get to the right answer.
When you ask this question, you're thinking, you've got to be happier in California if, for example, you're in Ohio.
And what's going on is that when you think about the travel in California, you're thinking about the contrast of California and other places, and the fact that the contrast is, for example, climate.
But it turns out that climate isn't really important for the experimal self, and it's not very important for the reflective self that decides how happy people are.
But because of the fact that the self reflective is to leadership -- some people could get to move in California.
And it's pretty interesting to look at what's going to happen with people who are moving in California, hoping that they're going to be happy.
So their experimental self is not going to become happier.
We know that.
But one thing will happen. They think they're happier.
because, when I'm silent to this, they're going to remember how horrible it was in Oho. And they're going to feel like they're making good decision.
It's very difficult to think simplistic about well-being, and I hope I'd give you a picture about how difficult is.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have a question for you.
Thank you very much.
A few weeks ago, when I talked about the phone, you've been talking about the phone, you'd get an interesting result of Gallup.
Do you think you're looking at this given me a few minutes?
Daniel Kahneman: Sure.
I think the most interesting result of the Gallup is a number that we wouldn't expect at all.
What we've learned is happiness of experimental self.
We looked at how the feelings in the income function.
and it turns out as a 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans, and this represents a large number of Americans interoged, about 600,000 dollars a year, which is a great extent, under 600,000 dollars a year...
CA: 60,000.
DK: 60,000 dollars a year, people are unfortunate, and they're very unfortunate, and they're getting more unfortunate, we get an absolute line.
I mean, I'd like to say, I've also seen a link.
It's clear that the money doesn't make it happiness, but they can measure this unfortunate unfortunately, and we can measure this unfortunately.
In terms of the other self, the memory, you have to do with another situation.
The more money you're satisfactured.
This is not true of emotions.
CA: But Danny, all of the American dream is about life, freedom, search for happiness.
If the world would take this serious discovery, I want to say, it's what we think about, for example, fiscal policy and so on.
There's a chance of politics, as the state in general, to take a very serious constatement and elabove policies in the audience based on it?
DK: You know, I think there's a rolling of the research of happiness research.
Recunwaiting is going to be slowly in the US, but in the UK, it's happening, and other countries are going on.
People realize that they should be thinking about happiness when they think about public policy.
It's going to take some time, and the world's going to be experimental happiness, or if they want to study their life, so we have to have this debate debate debate, because to improve happiness, there are different food, depending on how we think, and if we think about self at our memorial self.
That's going to the policy, I think, in the next years.
In the US, there's the efforts in the measurement of the world's measure of the world's happiness, in the next two decades, a part of the CA statistics is: that this subject is going to be, or at least most interesting politics of the most interesting policy of the world.
Thank you very much because you invented behavioral economy.
Thank you Danny Kahneman.
I'm going to talk about today about energy and climate.
And that may seem a little surprisingly, because my work on the foundation is about largely part of the vaccines, and the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poor two billion to live better.
But energy and climate are extremely important for these people, even more important than anyone else on the planet.
The worse of climate means that many years, they're not going to increase.
It's going to be too much rain, it won't be enough rain.
Things are going to change in ways that their fragile environment simply cannot be able to be.
And that leads to the hunger. They're uncomfortable.
climate change will be terrible for them.
Also, the price of energy is very important for them.
In fact, if we could choose one thing to get to get the price to reduce the price to reduce poverty, we choose from the energy.
Now, the price of energy has reduced in time.
Right, civilization is based on energy progress.
The coal revolution of food revolution and even in the 1990s, the price of [] [[], conditioned, we can create modern materials, and it does so many things.
And so we're in a wonderful situation in terms of the rich world.
But, once we do it cheaper -- and try to do it twice as cheaper -- we have to break a new constraint, and this constraint has to do with CO2.
CO2 heat the planet, and the CO2 is a very simple equation.
If we gather the CO2 stems, this leads to a temperature increase of temperature, and the growth of temperature leads to some very negative effects effects.
The effects over time, and maybe more gravely, the indirect effects so that the natural ecosystems can't adapt to these rapid changes, and that's how the collecosystem.
Now, the measure of the correlation between CO2 growth and the temperature of the CO2 and the growth of temperature and where there are positive reactions, still has a kind of uncertainty, but not very big.
And there's certainly uncertainty about how grave will be these effects, but they'll be extremely grave.
And we asked the scientists are marking science, in repeatedly repeatedly, we have to get close to zero?
Can we reduce a half or a sphere?
And the answer is that, until we can't get almost zero, it's going to increase.
So we have a big problem.
It's not the whole truck, and it's got to go under a three-footprint, and we could buy it.
Here's something that's got to zero.
Now, we're emitem a lot of carbon dioxide in every year, over 26 billion tons.
For every Americans are about 20 tons.
For the people in poor countries is less than a ton.
In the average level of the planet is about five tons for every human.
And somehow, somehow, we have to do changes that to zero.
It grew up.
It doesn't different economic changes have produced a kind of established, so we have to move from a rapid growth, and it gets down to zero.
Ecuation has four factors.
It could be lots of multiple.
So, we've got something on the left, CO2, that's going to be a zero, and that's going to be the number of people, the service is for every service and the service unit of energy.
Let's look at each of them and see how we can get to zero.
Now, one of these numbers will have to get pretty close to zero.
Now, that's from high school algebra, but let's take a look at it.
First, we have the population.
Now, the world has 6.8 billion people.
It's about nine billion.
Now, if we make a great job with new vaccines, our medical services and reproductive health care, we could get that with 10 or 15 percent, but here we see a increase of about 1,3.
The second factors are services that we use.
That's all the food that we eat, embracing, embrace.
These are really good things, and it's getting rid of poverty means giving these services about any of the planet.
And it's a great thing to increase.
In the wealthy world, maybe the first billion, we might be able to figure out and use a little less, but in every year, this digm in average, will increase, so in general, services are going to increase, so in general, services will increase in two times.
Here's a very elementary service.
Do you have light in the house to read you?
Well, these kids don't have, so they're going out and read the temes to the lightbulk.
And then efficiency, it's, the energy for every service, here's the energy.
We have something that doesn't grow.
By different inventions and ways of illumination, different types of cars, different types of cars, different types to build buildings, there's lots of services where you can reduce the energy for that services, even with 90 percent.
There's other services, for example of how we do we do the aerian transportation, or how we do the aerian transport,
So, in average, if we're optimistic, we might get a reduction of three to, maybe six times.
But for these three factors from now, we get from 26 billion tons in the best case, maybe 13 billion tons, and that's not enough.
So let's look at the patround -- this is going to be a key factor -- which is the CO2 of CO2 emide amount of energy.
And the question is, it can actually reduce it to zero?
If you throw the coal, not.
If you put gas natural gas, not.
Almost every method to produce electricity today, except the emerging methods and nuclear, emerging methods.
What we're going to do at the global scale, is to create a new system.
So, we need miracles of energy.
Now, when I use miracle, I don't mean something that is impossible.
The microprocessor is a miracle. Calculator is a miracle.
The Internet and his services are a miracle.
The people here have contributed to many miracles.
We don't have a term, to get a miracle to get a miracle until one time.
You're just waiting for some come, not.
That's a case where we really have to accelerate maximum and get a miracle in a pretty short interval.
I thought, how could I zoom?
Is there a natural illustration, about a demonstration that could stimulate people's imagination of people's imagination?
And I thought last year, we brought the mosquitos, and it seems to some of them.
He really involved it in the idea that, you know, are people who live with mosquitos.
Now, with energy, everything we could find was that.
And I thought I'm going to give a high school, and that's what my environment here in this year.
So here we have some natural license.
It was told I didn't weren't wouldn't come out of the board.
Now, there's all sorts of solutions like this, but they don't know what value.
We need solutions, one or more, who have an incredible scale, and they're very incredible, and they're looking for a lot of directions, I see just five that can produce large numbers.
I left the energy of the mass, geotermic, fusion, the biofuel, biofuel.
They might be able to contribute, and if they're going to ask my expectations, the better.
But what I'm going to put here is that we're going to have to work on each of these five, and we can't let any of them even if they seem significant,
Let's first look at the fossil fuels, whether it's a coal of coal.
What we have to do here, it seems simple, but it's not, it's not, we take the CO2, after I burning it, and we put it somewhere and hopefully remains there.
Now, we have some stuff that's doing this at the level of 60 to 80 percent, but the growth to the percentage, it will be very difficult, and it's going to be hard, and it's going to be hard, and that's the hardest problem.
Who will be sure?
Who's going to guarantee is literally billions of times bigger than any type of residue?
It's a very big volume.
It's a hard problem.
The next one would be nuclear power.
It has three big problems.
The cost, especially in strictly regular countries, it's great.
The problem of safety, to be linear that there's nothing can happen, that even though there's these human operators, the fuel doesn't be used for weapons.
And then what do you do with residential?
And even though there's not a lot of, we're concerned for a long time.
People have to feel good about the relationship with this.
So there are three very heavy problems that might have the solution, and so we should work on them.
The last three of the five I put together.
These are the ones that the world called renewable sources.
But they -- even though it's great that they don't need the fuel -- they have some disadvantage.
One is that the energy density of these technologies is much smaller than at an electrical central.
These are the energy farms, we're talking to many kilometers, a surface of thousands of times larger than at normal electrical electrical power.
And all of these are the sources.
The sun doesn't go all the day, and they don't have all the day, and the wind all the time.
If we depend on these sources, we need a way to get energy in those period of energy in those period when it's not available.
Here we have big problems.
We have difficulty.
For example, let's say it's a source of energy, you don't just need the technology, but you have to exposed to exposed to otherwise.
And finally, there's the store.
And in order to understand the size, we took all the battery types of the batteries that are products, for cars, computers, telephones, lantern, whatever.
We compared to the energy amount of energy that we consume the world, and we discovered that all the batteries that we've got all the battery that we're producing less than 10 minutes of the energy.
So, in fact, we need a big progress here, a solution of a hundred times better than what we have now.
It's not impossible, but it's not easy.
This problem is what we're going to be above, say, 20 -- 30 percent of the consumption.
If we rely on it for 100 percent, we need a miracle battery.
Now, how are we going to go further, what's the right?
Is it a Manhattan Project? What can it help us get there?
Well, we need a lot of firms to work on this, hundreds.
On each of those five roads, we need at least 100 people.
And in many of them, you're going to tell you that they're crazy. That's good.
I think here in the TED group, we have a lot of people who are already on this path.
Bill Gross has a few companies, between one called eSolar, which has some thermexcellent solar technologies.
Vinod Khospital investing in decades in tens of doing things, and they have interesting possibilities, and I'm trying to support it.
Nathan Myhrvold, and I'm really supported a company that, perhaps, follows the nuclear path.
There are some innovations in nuclear field: modularity, lichid.
But the innovation really stopped in this field now for a long time, so it wouldn't be surprising to be some good ideas on somewhere.
The TerraPower is that, instead of throwing a part of the uranium, that one percent that's U235, we decided to show the 99 percent of the U238.
It's a crazy idea.
In fact, it was talking about it for a long time, but he could never simulate how they should work or not.
Just because of the modern supercomputers appearance of modern supercomputers now can simulate and see that, really, using right materials, it turns out that it would work.
And because the 99 percent of the 99 percent, the cost-profile is much improved.
We're actually residential, and we can use all the residential residential residential residents of today.
Instead of worry about them, we use them. It's a great thing.
It's an uranium as it advances. It's like a kind of light.
You can see here a kind of buddy called "reactor". "
In terms of the fuel, that really solve the problem.
I've got a picture of a place in Kentucky.
These are residues, the 99 percent of the 99 percent remainly used.
It's called the poverty.
The energy needs of the United States of hundred years.
And by the simple movie filter in a unbelievable process, we'd have enough fuel for the entire planet.
So we expect a lot of difficulty, but it's an example of many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move.
Let's think about, how could we evaluate ourselves?
What should our carry of notes?
Well, let's see where we have to get, and then look at the steps.
For 2050 you heard a lot of the world talking about this 80 percent reduction.
It's very important to get there.
And those 20 percent will be consumption of what's going on in poor countries.
Let's hope we're going to be clever, the cycle.
In order to get to those 80 percent, developing countries, including countries, including countries like China, they'll have their production of electricity.
The other note is if we're applicating this technology with the zero emissions, if we went to all the developing countries, and we're going to lead it to the rest of the world.
That's great important.
This is a key element of notes.
Do we do a step back: How should the note card of notes in 2020?
Well, again, they should have two elements.
We should applicate these measurements to begin to have reductions.
The less we're emitem, the smaller will be the CO2, and so, so, lower temperature.
But in a way, the note that we get, doing things that don't take us to reductions, is just equal or maybe even less important than the other, which is the innovation of the innovation of these progress.
These progress need to get at the speeds, and that's that we can measure report with companies, pilot and regulations that have been changed.
There are lots of excellent books on this theme.
Al Gore's book "and our book" and the book of David MacKay, "The book" and our book. "
They take everything at the hand, and they create a structure so that the world can talk about these things, because we need a wide wided for that.
There's a lot of things to be done.
It's a desire.
It's a very concrete desire to invent this technology.
If I could just pick a desire for the next 50 years, I could choose who are the president, I could choose a coin, which I could choose me, or I could choose that: energy from the printer, or I could choose that: energy from the price, without CO2.
I'd like that.
It's got the biggest impact.
If we don't make this desire, division between the people who think about the short term and the long term will be awful, between the poor countries, and the rich countries of the poor countries, and particularly the lives of those two billion people will be much worse.
What do we have to do?
What do you're going to make you further and put in the movement?
We need more research funding.
When the countries are heading, for example at Copenhagen, I wouldn't just talk about CO2.
We should talk about this plan of innovation.
It's you how ridiculous of small are spending for these innovative research.
We need the markets and the markets of the CO2, the burning of the emissions, so that they've heard the prices.
We need to spread the message.
It has to be like this conversation to become more rational, smarter, including the measurements that the government takes.
It's an important desire, but I think we can fly.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. So, I'd better understand about TerraPower, first of all, can you give an idea about investments?
Bill Gates: In order to make the software, buying the supercomputer, employees of scientists, which we've done, there's just 10 million.
Even as as we test our materials in a rush reactor, to make sure that our materials work as we need, we're going to get to hundreds of millions.
The difficult part is the construction of the pilot, finding some billion, the authorities, the building of the authorities, the construction of the first one of those.
And you're building on the first one, if you go into the reclear, then it's clear like the day, because the economy, the density, they're very different from the nuclear areas.
CA: To understand how do we need to, that's building in the ground, at the deep, a kind of vertical columble fuel, and then the process starts, and then it starts out?
BG: That's right. These are all the time you have to reality the reactor, that there's a lot of people, and they're moving objects inside, and it's worth.
That's not good.
If you're very cheap fuel that you can put it in there 60 years -- we can get it into a poor -- you put it, and you don't put it, and you don't put it and complex.
It's just sitting there and burned 60 years, and then it's ready.
CA: It's a nuclear central strength that's the nuclear solution.
BG: Yeah. Well, what's going on with resides, you can leave them there -- there's much less residues in the way -- and then you can actually take it and put it into the other way.
And we're starting with the residents that are today, are now in a bad baseline or land in the reference, right now,
It's about this fuel fuel.
The thing that represent a problem for these reactors is really prime matter for our own and reduction volume of desire that through this process.
CA: But in the conversations with different people around the world about the possibilities, where did you find the biggest interest to do something concrete?
BG: I didn't have a precise place, and there's all these rules of nuclear field.
We're interested in that people in the company have led to Russia, India, China.
I met here with her energy minister, and I've been talking about the place of the energy agenda.
I'm optimistic. You know that French and the Japanese and Japanese had done a little bit.
This is a variant of something that's already done.
It's an important development, but it's like a rapid reactor and many countries have built, so that any of the countries that have built a rapidly reactor that's the first of them.
CA: What do you think, when and what the probability will you achieve?
BG: For one of the large electrical generations that's very cheap for 20 years to invent it and then 20 years to implement it.
That's what the limit of the environmental models have shown us that we need to break it.
And TerraPower, if things go well, what's a big desire, it could easy term.
Now, there are lucky, tens of companies, we need to be hundreds, which also, if they're doing good, if it's going well, if it's going well, I can make it for it.
And it's the best if I'm able to combine things.
We need one to do it.
CA: Like changes on the scale, is this largest that you know?
BG: A power revolution is the most important thing.
It would be even without the limits of the environment, but the environmental limitations are doing so much more significant.
It's in nuclear field are other innovators.
You know, we don't know their work as well like this, but there's the work, but there's the work.
There's also a liquid reactor, which looks a little hard, but maybe they say the same about us.
So there's a variety.
The beauty is that an uranium molecule has a million times more energy than, say, one coal molecule.
So if we can solve the negative parts, which is essentially the radiation, then the footprint, the environment, it's the environment, it's the potential, the effect, the potential of the land and so on, it's almost a single classroom.
CA: But if it won't work?
Do we have to start taking emergence measure to keep the emergence temperature?
BG: If we're in this situation, and when you're eating too much, and you're on the point of taking a heart attack.
So what do you do? You might need to have charge surgery or something.
There's a research direction in what's called geoengineering, which cause different techniques to both about 20 or 30 years, until we organize.
But that's just an insurance.
We hope you don't need it.
Some people say, we don't even have to work on the insurance police, because they could make us lazy, that we're going to eating because we know that it will save us the cardiac surgery.
I don't think that's the importance of view of the problem, but there's in geoengineering the discussion, if we wouldn't put the policy in case that things are preparing or if this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect.
CA: The change of climate change: in a sentence or two, what would you say, is that they're wrong?
BG: Unfortunately, unfortunately, the skeptics of different camps.
Those who have scientific arguments are very few.
I'm saying there's effects of negative reaction to negative reaction?
There are very, very few things that I can say.
They have a chance from a million right.
The main problem here is like the AIDS.
You're doing wrong now and pay for it for a much later.
When you're all sorts of emergency problems, the idea is to get a win now to have a win, and it's kind of emerge.
We actually have the IPCC, who don't reflect the case of the worst, and there's people in the rich world that's looking at IPCC and say, "Well, it's not so big.
In fact, the uncertainty should change our towards that.
But my dream here is to achieve a economic screen, and then the CO2 simultaneously to break and the limits of CO2, and then the skeptics will say, well, I don't really care that I wouldn't empty, but I'd get it because it's more cheap than before.
CA: So this would be your response to Bjorn Lomborg's argument, who says that if they're consuming so much energy to solve us to solve the CO2, we're trying to get the world of poverty, malaria and other things, that we're doing things.
BG: It's actually spending the research part and development -- let's say that the United States should spend 10 billion a year than now -- I'm not really so dramatic.
It wouldn't remain things.
The thing you're spending a lot, and here's people who can't agree, it's when you're trying to fund something.
That, for me, it's largely rise, outside of the situation when you're almost ready, and you're just funding to learn, and it's going to become very cheap.
I think we should try a lot more things that have the potential to be much easier.
If we get to the compromise of making energy super expensive super, then rich can allow that.
Even one of us here could pay five times more on energy without change our own life.
Devastruos is for those two billion.
And even Lomborg changed.
His is is: why don't they're not talking more about the research?
Because of things in the past he's continuing associated with the skepty camp, but he realized that it's a fairly fairly, so it's the problem of the research.
It's a fairly fairly, I think.
It's part of the development and development, it's crazy as bad is.
CA: Okay, I suppose I'm talking about the name of the most of me here when I'm telling you you're going to make your desire.
BG: Thank you.
I'm going to share with you a discovery of a few months ago, while I was writing an article for Italian Wired Italian.
When I write, I've always got the dictionary.
But I'd already done by writing this article, and I realized that the word "" disability "in dictionary."
I'm going to read your definition.
"Dizability't's, substantival,'s unclear, unusual, unusual, stagnasted, mutilated, unusual, stagnasted, a staggregated, flag, skycle, exuded, seshot, smoored, bear, syells,, syful, burids, slished, bryp---------------------belled, selled, ypes, ypes, ypes, bling, ypeled, com--------------ypes, ypelled, ypeled, brized, yed, bracked
You're looking at, unuseful and slab.
Antonime: healthy, powerful, capable.
I read the list of a friend and I've got laughter.
It was absurd.
And after I went from "schilodit" schilodit's voice, and I had to return my voice, and I had to return out of these words.
It was my old dictionary.
I thought, maybe, it was printed.
But it came out of the pattern of the '80s, when I first started school, and I was going to understand where I'm framework out of my world.
Let's let's take a dictionary.
After this definition, I was born in a world who believed that someone like me has no positive.
But today, I'm grateful for opportunities and the adventure that I procurated my life.
So, I looked at the online environment in 2009, hoping to find a major change.
Here's the new version of the definition.
Unfortunately, there's nothing better.
The last two words, under's "Oh," I'm, "I" "and" "" and "" "" and "'s"
Not just the words are the problem.
It's what we call about the people we call this way.
It's the values behind the words and how we build them.
Our change our thinking, and the way we see the world and the other people.
In fact, many ancient societies, including the Greeks and romans, believed that a blindness was very strong, because when you tell him with voice, they would make it exists.
So what do we want to create?
One person who has limitations or a powerful person?
So, in fact, we call a man, a child, we might be able to stop the power that it has.
Wouldn't we open it?
A guy who opened me a door of my childhood's a child's Delaware of the Delaware, Delaware.
His name is Dr.Pizzutilloaded.
American origin of Italian origin, whose name is too difficult to Americans.
So Dr.P. "
Dr.P., always wild papers, and he had the purposes to work with children.
I've spent the time at the hospital, except the physical therapy.
They had to make nenums practice with these elastithical benefits, different colors, to keep me the muscle of legs.
I was going to go out of those bends.
I hit them.
Although I was five years, I was trying to convince Dr.P. to let me give up those exercises, of course, without any successful.
And one day, she came to my fairy...
They were a dure and failure.
And he said,'s, "Aimee, you're a little girl so powerful girl," I think you're going to take one of these things. "You know," When you break it, I'll give you your 100 dollars. "
But what he did was transform a daily obligation into a new experience and promise.
And I'm wondering today, as the fact that I'm a strong face of how I see I see today, as a strong person.
That's an example of how adults that have the power of a child.
But by those definitions of dictionary, our language doesn't allow us to create the reality that we all want, as an individual to be able to be capable.
Our lay is not at the current changes of societies, many of them being products.
Of course, from a medical point, my legs, my legs, the operation with laser, the titan protests for the knenees and have them, that allowed people to put them into the skills of their skills, and to turn the limits of nature, so we don't talk to them, to be able to be able, and that people can enenenenencouraged the online online social social social platformings of self-sure the self-definitely enished, and they be that they be that they be that we be be be be be be that they be that they be able the self-definitely ends to us to self-definitely can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can be be be be be be be be be be able people in in the self-self-self-self-self-sure our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our
Maybe we're more clear revealing now that has always been true.
The fact that every human has something rare and powerful to provide society, and that the human ability to adapt is the most of our win.
The action of the human to adapt is an interesting thing, because people will always talk to them about overcome the adversities, and I'm going to tell you about the adversities, and I'm going to give you a marry.
I'm never paid this expression, and I said to people's questions about it.
I think I started to understand why.
It's in the question of adversity is, and the idea that the success or happiness is, and the idea that the success or happiness is that it, like my successful in my life comes from the capacity to oppose college of suppressions of a protest, and what other like my disability.
But in fact, we're changing us. We're obvious about a physical challenge or emotional challenge.
I want to suggest that this is a good thing.
It's not a obstacle that we need to overcome, so that we can live in our lives.
It's part of our lives.
I think it's a kind of shadow.
Sometimes, I'm quite a lot of other, but it's always with me.
I didn't try to get the impacts of a person's lum.
In life, there's been adversity and challenges for each of us, but the question isn't if you meet this adversity, but the way you're going to respond to it.
And so, our deeply is not just to protect them from the adversity that we love, but to prepared to prepared them.
We're making a deserve children, when we make them feel unable to feel the incapable of to adapt.
There's an important difference between the medical that we've had an amputation and subjective opinion of society, if we have no disability.
And to be honest, the only real disability that I'm the only real disability with those definitions.
Our desire to protect those who we love, telling the truth of the truth about diagnosis, or diagnostic, or diagnostic, or the diagnosis, we need to take care of us not to be primarily.
It's just what's wrong with you can be much more harder than pathology itself.
Because we don't treat the person in her totality, and we don't recognize the resistance, and we don't recognize the resistance,
We're literally evaluate the importance of that human in society.
So we've got to see through pathology that it's able to be a human.
And especially, it's a partnership between those deficiency and the most creative ability.
We don't have to become or negate these difficult moments, or to avoid these difficult moments, and we're going to find the opportunities that they have adversities.
The idea I'm going to put it is not just to overcome our adversity, but also to open us to open it, let's get it, to make it silk, to make it with it.
And maybe we're going to see the adversity as a natural, consistent and useful, something that doesn't get down.
In this year, Charles Darwin: 200 years ago, and 150 years ago, when he was writing about evolution, Darwin illustrated a truth of human character.
To paraphrase, not the most powerful species survives, and even the most intelligent species survives, but that can adapt to change.
It generates creation.
Darwin's work from Darwin's papers, we can see that the ability to survive and to swimp the human beings, from conflict to turn.
Again, transformation, adaptation is the largest human attribute.
And maybe, until we're tested, we don't know why we are able.
Maybe that makes us adversity: a sense of the self, knowledge of our own powers.
So we can make our own gift.
We can redefine adversity like something more than some hard time.
We can see it as a change.
Adversity is the change that we still haven't adapt.
I think the largest adversity that we created is the idea of normality.
Who is normal?
There's no normal.
There are common traits, patterns, but not normal.
And do you really want to know a banal person?
I don't think.
If we can change this paradigm from the aspiration to the normality or force, to say a little bit more, we can release the force of many children, and we can reach them to use the valuable ability.
Anthropologists tell us that the only thing we people, I asked him from the community members of the community members was to be able to contribute.
He discovered that people of Neanderthal, about 60,000 years ago, they've got 60,000 years ago, they've found them to be valuable for the community.
They wouldn't see these people as unusual or unusual.
They were considered rare and valuable.
A few years ago, I was in a market in my hometown, in that red area in the red city of Nsylvania, and I'm looking at a red box.
It was summer. I was in short pants.
I heard the voice of a man behind me: "I would be, if it's not really Aimee." "I went back, and I saw a old man I couldn't know.
I said, "I'm excuse. Do I know? I remember." "She said," "" No, "" Don't remember me. "
"When we knew, I was just helping my mom, I just helped my mom to do."
So he was.
And I remember.
That man was Dr.K., a man I just knew of my mother's stories of my mom, because, I usually came to the world with a late first weeks.
And my mother's doctor left six in the vacation.
So the one who helped me to bring my world was a stranger for my parents.
And because I was born without the printing legs, because I was bad legs and just a few feet, he had to give them the bad news.
She said,'s, "He had to say's's" "" "" "" "" "" ""'s "
"But you've shown me that I was wrong."
When I won the mapping of the city in the second, when I was with otherwise certainly in the Halloween, when I took off to college or my sports.
He gave them the residents of residents, the medicine in the schools of Hahnems and Hershey.
And it's called this "X" Factor, the potential of human voice.
None diagnostic could not stand in the way of your power of voice, as driving someone's lives.
And Dr.Kean me said,'s my experience, if you don't say, "" "'s" and if you've got the smallest supports. "
Dr.Kean did that change in mentality.
He understood that there's a difference between the diagnosis, and the way anyone reacts to him.
And my mentality has changed over time.
If you'd wondered about 15 years if I'd give the prostheses in your feet, and I wouldn't have no second.
And at that time, I was aspiram at that kind of normality.
If you ask me today, I'm not so sure.
And that's thanks. "
Maybe this change in me, because I've been exposed to many people who opened me up with my face.
So, you see, you don't need a person to have the revelation of your own power, and you're on your own power.
If you can give them the key to someone's the key to its own power, the human spirit is so receptive -- if you can do this, and you open them to a crucial moment, you've got them.
You learn how to open their doors.
In fact, the word "educate's" he's called "education" "'s" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" has "
It means to put in the first plan that's inside the potential value.
So, again, what's potential, what's the potential?
There was a case of the U.K., in the U.K., in the '60s, when they' 60s, when they're gone from the classical schools.
It's about the students.
They're separated from A, with B, with C, on D, etc.
Elevy with A had a harder programs, the best teachers.
For three months, I've got three months, D students got told that I was a A, I was told that they're smart.
And after this three months, they had the note.
The medals was that I'm asking students's told that I was the D.
And that happened after three months.
Some of them were in school. Some gave up the studies.
The crucial part of this study is that the teachers were bird.
They didn't know it changed.
They were told that students have A, and they've got D.
And they treated her.
I think the only handicap is a spirit, which doesn't have hope.
It doesn't see the beauty.
It doesn't have the natural curiosity of the child, and the in-capacity capacity.
If, instead, we can determine the spirit of a human hope, to see the beauty out of the beauty, to see the beauty and the imagination, it means that we use our power.
When a spirit has those qualities, we can create new realities and new ways of being.
I want to leave you with a poet, written by a poet persan poet in century, named Hafiz, which he told me my friend Jacques Dembois.
Poetry is called "My God who knows just four words."
"Every child known. The God." The God. "" No God, "" "" "" "" "" "
"Vino and dancing me." Thank you.
