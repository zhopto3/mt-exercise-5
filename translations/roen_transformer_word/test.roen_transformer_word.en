A few years ago, here at TED, <unk> <unk> has <unk> a problem called the <unk> problem.
And the idea is pretty simple.
The <unk> of four, we need to build the <unk> structure of 20 <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> <unk>, a <unk> of <unk>, a <unk> of <unk> and a <unk>.
The <unk> has to stay.
And, although it looks pretty simple, it's actually pretty hard, because it <unk> people to <unk> very quickly.
And so I <unk> that's an interesting idea, and I <unk> in a design <unk>.
And it was a great success.
And since then, I've <unk> about 70 <unk> design all over the world with <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, actually <unk> the <unk> <unk> from 50 <unk>, and something from this <unk> <unk> to the good <unk> about the nature of <unk> <unk>, and I would like to <unk> you a few.
So, <unk> people start by <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They're talking about her, they <unk> what they would look like, they're <unk> for power, and they spend some time <unk>, <unk>.
And the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> spend most of the time <unk> <unk> in structures that were <unk> and then at the end, even when they don't have time, someone takes the <unk>, and then they give it a <unk> to the <unk>, and <unk>!
They <unk> work.
But, what's actually happening in most of the <unk>, is that "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" because the <unk> <unk> <unk> into a <unk>, because the <unk> <unk> <unk> to make the whole structure and <unk>.
And there's a number of people who have a lot more <unk> "<unk>" than others, and among the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They <unk>, they <unk> their <unk>, and they <unk> <unk> structures.
And of course, there are <unk> that have a lot more <unk> structures, "and, among the best, are <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's pretty amazing.
As <unk> tells the <unk>, not only produce the most <unk> structures, but also the most interesting of all.
So you'd like to ask: How? Why are they? Why? Why?
And <unk>'s <unk> them like, "<unk> between children, not the time trying to be <unk> <unk> <unk>." That is.
And it doesn't <unk> time for power.
But there's another reason.
This is that the <unk> are <unk> to find the only plan, isn't it?
And we <unk> it.
And what's going on is that, when I'm <unk> at the top, are at the time, and what's going on?
It's a crisis.
You know? That's it.
What they're doing different from <unk>, is that they start with <unk>, and they're building <unk>, <unk> <unk> at the top, so they have more <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
So <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And every <unk>, the kids have an answer right now, and what it doesn't work.
So the ability to build in <unk> is <unk>, and let's see how many different <unk>.
So the media is about 20 <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, are about half, <unk>, <unk>, a little bit better, but not with much, kids, better than most of the <unk>.
Who is the best?
<unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> structure that we have <unk> has <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And why is it? Because they understand that <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> structures.
So, <unk> <unk>, a little bit better than media.
But here's interesting.
If the <unk> <unk> a man from the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's incredible. You see, you look around and <unk>, "This is the <unk> team."
You can say that <unk>. And why is this?
Because they <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, I understand the process.
And any team that <unk> and is <unk> at the <unk> will <unk> their <unk>.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>, and their <unk> leads to <unk>.
If you have 10 <unk> that are starting to build, you will have about six structures that will stand in your legs.
And I tried something interesting.
I thought, let's <unk> <unk>.
And I gave a <unk> of 10 thousand dollars in <unk> <unk> programs.
And what do you think about those <unk> to design?
What was the result?
Here's what happened.
The <unk> team didn't built something to stay in legs.
If a team would built, let's say, a <unk> structure, a three <unk>, they could have taken home <unk>.
So, isn't interesting that big <unk> have a powerful impact?
I <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What do you think happened?
<unk> now <unk> value.
And the same team has gone from the <unk> <unk> to one of the best results.
They <unk> the most <unk> structure.
So here are some <unk> <unk> for us about the nature of <unk> and success.
So, would you know, why would you lose someone time <unk> in such a problem?
And the reason is, I'm <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk> used by <unk> what cars and video games and video games are <unk>.
And what that makes this challenge of <unk> is that it helps to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Because, in fact, every project has its own <unk>, isn't it?
This challenge a <unk> experience, a common <unk>, a common <unk>, an <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of a right <unk>.
And so, this is the value of this <unk>, this <unk> so simple.
And for those <unk>, you can <unk> <unk>. It's a <unk> where you can see how to <unk> with <unk>.
They're also <unk> step up about this.
There are some examples of all over the world how people change and <unk> the system.
You can find <unk> <unk>.
And <unk> <unk>, I think it's the fact that the <unk> is really a <unk> <unk>.
It <unk> us to <unk> all the <unk>, and to understand what we have better in thinking, <unk> and <unk> for <unk> in front of us.
And sometimes, a <unk> of this <unk> is the only thing necessary to make a moment "<unk>" <unk> "at a moment" <unk> "<unk>."
And that can make <unk>.
Thank you very much.
So let's think that we have a <unk>, a big <unk>, <unk>, TED, which is a time machine.
And they're all in this <unk>, you have to go into it.
You can go back or before, but you can't stay where you.
I wonder the <unk> of <unk>, because I asked them this question in the last while and they all wanted to go back in time.
They don't know. They want to <unk> before <unk> <unk>, before Twitter <unk> or "<unk> <unk>."
I don't know.
I'm sure there's a certain <unk> <unk>.
But we have to realize that they are not part of this group.
I don't want to go back in time, and I don't have any <unk> of <unk>, but because I'm <unk> on this planet not <unk>, but <unk>.
So I want to <unk> in the car and go forward.
It's the best period of this planet in any point, you know, health, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
There was no <unk> as well.
My <unk> <unk> died before <unk> 60 years ago.
My parents came to 70.
My <unk> is 80.
So it would be good to be <unk> at the beginning of the <unk> that I'm going to <unk>.
But it's not even about people like new, because it's much more important than that.
A child who is <unk> in New <unk> has a <unk> <unk> of life than having the <unk> man in the world's <unk> 100 years ago.
Think about that. It's an incredible phenomenon.
And why is true?
<unk>. <unk> has <unk> billion people.
It <unk> the <unk> data on a <unk> way to nothing else.
It's not. It's gone.
I <unk>. <unk>!
In the <unk> world, <unk> that <unk> million people with just a <unk> behind there is no longer there.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>...
Who knows what all this means?
<unk>, modern <unk>, our ability to <unk> billion people are <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And I <unk> that the <unk> <unk>, put things on the <unk>, he's going to <unk> if they don't, is one of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk>.
These are good <unk>.
<unk>, there's no more and others because there are other problems, because there are other problems, in many times, one of them are <unk> <unk> every day.
This number one very quickly, and it's <unk>.
Not just that, but we've used <unk> to <unk> this planet.
<unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>: they're all on the <unk> and will <unk> <unk> soon.
If we don't <unk> a way to <unk> from this <unk>, we will <unk> and new.
The question is: Can we do that? I think yes.
I think it's obvious that we can produce food to <unk> billion people without <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>.
I think we can <unk> this world with energy that's not going to <unk> it.
I really think that, and it's not just a <unk>.
But here's what it doesn't let me <unk> -- one of the things that don't let me <unk>.
We've never had more <unk> <unk> than now, and we haven't ever found in the <unk> to use it in the way we can do today.
We are in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in more <unk>.
<unk>, I think we should go back with three hundreds of years in time, before the <unk> <unk>, to discover a period in which we've been <unk> for <unk>, for all these things with more <unk> and more <unk> than now.
People are <unk> to their <unk>, that you can't <unk>.
It's not even going to <unk>.
Everybody has the right to a <unk>; <unk> really has the right to have a <unk> about <unk>, but you know what you don't have the right?
You don't have your right to your own <unk>. I'm sorry, but that's like that.
And it took me a little bit of this.
Now, about 10 years ago, I wrote an <unk> on <unk> for "The New <unk>,"; a little <unk> <unk>.
I was <unk> to <unk>, I was <unk> to what, at the end, is the <unk> <unk> as public health in the history of <unk>.
<unk> <unk> to do, so I did what I usually do, I've written a <unk> <unk>, I wrote a <unk> <unk> on.
<unk> after that, I wrote a <unk> on <unk> <unk>.
The last thing, only is more important.
People have <unk> <unk>.
So I wrote a <unk> about this, and we couldn't understand why people said it's "food <unk> <unk>," why he <unk> to change in a way, not <unk> <unk>, it meant to <unk> the <unk> of nature.
But, as you know, I do what I do. I wrote <unk>, I went further.
They're just <unk>; <unk>, <unk>, we go to <unk>, everything rule.
But these <unk> <unk> me, and I didn't know why. And then I got it.
It was because those <unk> who <unk> me in the <unk> were not <unk> at all.
There were people with <unk>, <unk>, in their place.
They were just like people in this <unk>.
And it <unk> me so much --
But then I thought, let's be <unk>.
We are at the point where we don't have the same <unk> with <unk> like now.
I'm talking about him.
We're talking about him in <unk> terms of <unk>, "<unk>."
Okay, there's reasons for that, and I think we know that are these reasons.
We lost our <unk> in <unk>, in <unk>, and sometimes in science.
And we've got to do it.
You can <unk> a few names and people will understand.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
You can <unk> your own <unk>.
These are questions and <unk> <unk> to individuals who <unk> that they have always right.
So, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> questions, <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
There's nothing good.
But here's the idea: when <unk> <unk> <unk>, we need to <unk> them. We don't really <unk> about that.
And I can tell it because we're in the middle of a <unk> of <unk> dimensions so far and that I hope to do not even more <unk>.
Now about 12 years ago, a <unk>, one <unk>, which was <unk> between <unk> <unk> and <unk> against <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
Very <unk>.
We've made studies to <unk> whether this is true.
It really <unk> to make studies; it's an important problem.
They have come and the results.
<unk> in the United States, in Britain, from <unk>, from <unk> and all the same thing: there is no <unk>, no <unk>, absolutely <unk>.
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter, because we take <unk> <unk>, we think what we see, what we're seeing, which makes us feel <unk>.
We don't believe a lot of <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk> that gives data and understand that, I think we all understand this.
But you know what?
The <unk> were <unk>, and this is why: The United States is one of the <unk> countries in the world where the <unk> <unk> against <unk> is in <unk>.
This is about <unk>, we should be <unk>.
It's <unk>.
So what did we get here?
<unk>, I really understand.
<unk> anybody <unk> <unk>?
Have you ever seen someone in the public <unk> ever of <unk>?
It's not really going on.
<unk> that's not happening at all, but it has happened to <unk> times over the world last year.
A lot of <unk> because of <unk>, 20 cases per hour.
But, because this is not what happened, we can't think about it and people like <unk> <unk> can <unk> the <unk> of fear and <unk> using <unk> like <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And I can do that because they do not <unk> between <unk> and <unk>.
They don't understand that these seem the same thing, but they never do before.
And we've got to do this as soon.
This guy, <unk> <unk>, was a <unk>.
<unk> <unk> by one of the largest <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> in the middle -- not too.
He <unk> Paul <unk>.
What he's developed a <unk> against a <unk> <unk> with other few.
<unk> <unk> <unk> children from developing countries every year.
All right, right?
It's good, just that Paul <unk> talks about <unk> and how they're <unk> and that people should just <unk> to <unk>.
That's the way.
So Paul is a <unk>.
When Paul talks in a public <unk>, he can't <unk> <unk> without being <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> <unk> at home, because people like to tell him that I know what school are going to go.
Why? Because Paul did a <unk>.
I don't need to say that, but <unk> are <unk>.
If you <unk> them, <unk> <unk>, <unk> disease, and that's what happens now.
In this country, we have <unk> now.
It's worse, and <unk>, soon, the children will come back from this, because it's just a <unk> problem.
And they're not going to just <unk>.
What about <unk>? Let's have <unk>. Why don't it?
A few weeks ago, he was <unk> by <unk>, and he said to me that there was about <unk>.
No one said to me.
It wasn't going to <unk> their child against <unk>.
<unk>.
All right.
Why? Because we don't have <unk>. Do you know anything?
<unk> don't have any cases of <unk> in the country.
But now I don't know, maybe a guy's <unk> in an <unk> <unk>, and it's going to <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> now is on top of the <unk>.
It's going to <unk> two hours, it will <unk> a car, and it will come into the <unk> <unk> and <unk> to one of these beautiful <unk> <unk>.
It doesn't know it's <unk> with a disease that <unk> <unk> and we don't know, because that's how the world works.
This is the planet that we live. Let's't <unk> that it's not.
We like to <unk> in <unk>. We like that in <unk>.
<unk> took everyone to <unk> <unk>?
<unk>, a little bit <unk> to <unk>.
I know you've done this because half of the U.S. <unk> does this every day.
<unk> these things and <unk> to <unk> <unk>, and it doesn't matter how often <unk> they're completely <unk>.
<unk> show every time.
<unk> make <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, usually nothing more.
It's okay, it's okay, you want to <unk> <unk> <unk> to color.
<unk> than that.
It's <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> to color.
Why do we do that?
I think I understand -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> government. We don't have <unk>.
And we shouldn't have to have our <unk> health.
It's <unk> to millions of people.
It's incredibly cold and <unk> <unk> to the people who <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
So he's <unk>. And <unk> <unk>?
<unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But in fact, there's something very serious because these are some <unk> and <unk> on them billions of dollars.
I've got here all sorts of <unk> objects.
Many of them -- <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, that I don't even know what it is, but we spend billions of dollars on this, <unk>.
And you know what? When I say, people <unk> to me, and I say, "You don't care? <unk> people to do what they want to do them to make them feel good."
You know anything? <unk>.
Because I don't care about whether the state of the <unk> <unk> is the one who says, "<unk>, I don't take the <unk> of my <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>" or there's a <unk> that wants to <unk> cancer using <unk>.
When a <unk> on the way that you <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>, you get into a place where you get your <unk> to <unk> you.
<unk> in South Africa of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> people <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> are much more <unk> than the <unk> <unk> that we know the <unk> of AIDS.
<unk> of thousands of <unk> <unk> <unk> in a country country more than any disease.
<unk>, I don't think there's no <unk> for that.
There are <unk>.
The most <unk> sense of the <unk> sense that <unk> us right now is this <unk> struggle between the genetic <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. We need to <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk> to words, at <unk>.
It's <unk>, not science.
I have <unk>, every <unk> of <unk>, every <unk> of <unk>, every <unk> of <unk>, every <unk> of <unk> was <unk>.
In <unk>, I don't <unk> <unk>.
And no <unk> <unk>.
We did not <unk> <unk>. We made them.
We've done this over the last <unk> years.
Some of them were fine, some of them were okay,
We've <unk> the ones that were not.
Now we can do it in a <unk> way.
<unk>, there are <unk>.
But we can put <unk> in <unk>, and that can help millions of people, just millions of people, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Do you want to do that?
You have to understand that I don't understand.
<unk> against <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Why do we do that?
Well, we're always <unk> things like, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, we don't want to <unk> <unk> on which is one thing.
We don't want companies to <unk> life.
We don't want companies to <unk> <unk>.
You know what my answer to all this?
Yeah, you're right. Let's <unk> that.
This is, we have a big problem with food, but that's not science.
This is nothing to do with <unk>.
It's <unk>, it's <unk>, it's <unk>.
You know, <unk> is not <unk> by a company.
It's not a country.
There's no idea; it's a process.
It's a process that sometimes works, and the <unk> doesn't, but the idea that we shouldn't <unk> them to do the work because it's <unk> is very <unk> and <unk> millions of people to <unk>.
In the next 50 years, we will have to <unk> by 70 percent more food than today.
70 percent.
Here's what <unk> have done in Africa over the last 30 years.
<unk>. <unk>.
They need that, we don't <unk> them.
Why? <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We don't want to <unk> people to <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>.
500 million people <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's kind of like a <unk>.
Just <unk>. It's <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and the scientists are all this in it right now.
And then people will be able to <unk> it without <unk>.
They're not going to <unk> <unk>, and you know anything?
It would be good at <unk> <unk>, but it would be good.
All I can tell is: Why do we <unk>?
Let's ask this question: Why do we <unk>?
Because we don't want to <unk> <unk>?
It's just about <unk> <unk>. It's not about <unk>.
It's not about our <unk> <unk> for <unk>, about <unk> to have <unk> dimensions, better <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
It's not about <unk> for <unk> <unk>, but about <unk> people in life and came time to understand what this means.
Because, you know what?
If we don't do it, if we continue to <unk> as we <unk> now, we're going to be <unk> by something that I don't think we want to be <unk>, which is <unk> <unk>.
We can't describe what's going on.
It's <unk>, it's <unk>, it's <unk>, it's <unk>.
So, after this incredibly <unk> <unk>, can you say, "So, you still want to <unk> in this <unk> machine?"
<unk>. Of course.
Now it's <unk> now, but we have a <unk> <unk>.
We can <unk> the <unk> of time we want.
We can <unk> anywhere we want, and we really do.
We need to <unk> these <unk>, and we need to think, but when we go back in the <unk> of time, and we go forward, we will do that.
I know, I know that I think we can also need the world now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
One day the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> at the center of the <unk> <unk> when he heard a beautiful music.
And <unk> was a man, a <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, a man of <unk>, <unk> to a <unk> that had just two <unk>.
And I tell you a story that many many of you know, because <unk> wrote a lot of <unk> that became the basis of a book, by <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> by a <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> at the school, he went through a <unk> <unk>, and 30 years later, <unk> on the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It <unk> to all of you to <unk>'s book, or see the film to <unk> not only <unk> <unk> that were <unk> between these two people, but also how music has helped the <unk> of that <unk>, and eventually it was <unk>, <unk> for words, to help the <unk> not to stay on the <unk>.
I met <unk> <unk> in <unk>, two years ago, at the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk>'s <unk> and came behind the <unk>, and he <unk> him.
<unk> in a very <unk> way and <unk> <unk> about <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and how the <unk> in the <unk> will never get into the <unk>, everything because of an <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the last part of the <unk> <unk> of <unk>'s <unk>.
I was talking about music. I got a <unk> from <unk> a few days later <unk> that <unk> was interested in a <unk> <unk> with me.
Now, we have to <unk> that the <unk> <unk> to make treatment because when he was <unk> with <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, and that's what he's left his whole life.
But, as a result now, it's <unk> to these <unk> <unk>.
The worst of them can <unk> as he <unk>, and I <unk> more days, <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, <unk> to those <unk>, with <unk> of <unk>'s mind.
And the <unk> was very <unk> when we started our first <unk> at <unk> <unk> <unk> had a kind of <unk> <unk> on <unk>, it was lost.
And I'm talking about <unk> and <unk>, and how someone <unk> him in <unk>.
And I was <unk>, not for me, but it was <unk> that I was going to lose him in one of his <unk>, and that I'm going to <unk> him in one of his <unk>, and that I'm going to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
So I started <unk>.
And I <unk> the first part of the <unk> for <unk>'s <unk>.
And as I <unk>, I understood that a <unk> change in <unk>'s eyes.
It was like under the <unk> of <unk> drugs, a <unk> <unk>, for which I was <unk> music to me was <unk>.
And the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>, a <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
And as a <unk>, he <unk> up his own <unk>, and he started <unk>, after <unk>, some of the <unk> for the <unk> that <unk> me to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And we started to talk about music, from <unk> to <unk>, and <unk>, <unk>, all of the <unk> <unk>, from <unk> to <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
And I realized that he didn't only have <unk> <unk> about music, but he had a personal <unk> with music.
I'm talking about it with that <unk> and <unk> that I <unk> with my colleagues from <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And while I was <unk> and <unk> music, this was from a human <unk>, <unk> that just <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> in this <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> to <unk>.
<unk> is <unk>. <unk> change us.
And for <unk>, music is <unk> health.
Because the music allows them to take their own <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> them through his <unk> and <unk>, in reality.
And this is a <unk> in the state of <unk>.
And I understood that is <unk> <unk>.
This is why we do music, we take something that's in us, in our <unk>, our <unk>, and with our <unk>, and with our <unk>, with our <unk>, <unk> those <unk> in reality.
And the reality of that <unk> <unk> us all, and we <unk>, and <unk> us and <unk> us.
And for <unk>, music has <unk> him back to the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> him back into a family of <unk> who understand him, and he <unk> him.
I'm going to make music with <unk>, whether we're at <unk> <unk> <unk>, or in <unk> <unk>, because I remember why I became <unk>.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: Thank you. Thank you.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: I want to <unk> something that we <unk> without <unk> from <unk>.
So, please let me <unk>.
They're <unk> <unk>. They're a <unk> <unk>.
They are <unk> online for 10 years now.
And my goal for the next <unk> is to try to <unk> the world in real life as you can <unk> the world in <unk> online.
Now, I've got a plan for that, and I wanted to <unk> more world, including the <unk> here, to <unk> more time <unk> and better games.
<unk> <unk> three billion hours a week <unk> <unk> online games.
Some of you might think, "It's a lot of time spent games."
Maybe too long, <unk> of <unk> problems have to <unk> in the real world.
But, the <unk> of my <unk> <unk>, is exactly on the <unk>.
<unk> billion hours on <unk> is not not far far away for the game for <unk> to solve the world.
In fact, I think, if we want to <unk> the <unk> century on this planet, we have to <unk> this number of hours.
We have <unk> <unk> that we need at <unk> billion of game every week.
So, that's probably a little <unk> idea.
So I'm going to tell you again, I'm going to leave.
If we want to solve problems like <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, global <unk>, I think we need to <unk> to <unk> to <unk> games online for at least <unk> billion hours a week to <unk> this. I'm <unk>.
Here's why this picture. This image <unk> to <unk> why I think <unk> are so <unk> for the future of human <unk>. In the good <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> by a <unk> called <unk>.
He wanted to <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
So he <unk> a camera in front of the <unk>, while they were <unk>.
And this is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Now, if you're not an <unk> <unk> may be part of the <unk> of this photographs.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, but <unk>, <unk> <unk> for <unk> a very difficult problems.
If you're a <unk>, you'll see some <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> and around the <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
And the <unk> <unk> are a <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> that's about something called a <unk> <unk>.
Oh, you've heard of that. OK. OK.
So we have some <unk> among us.
A <unk> <unk> is a result that's so <unk> that you didn't believe you can't believe that you can touch until you don't believe that you can touch it.
It was almost beyond <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And when you get there to be so <unk> to discover that you're really <unk>. This is a <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> about to get a <unk> <unk>.
And this is the face we need to look at at the <unk> of people who are <unk> problems around the world as we're trying to <unk> the <unk> century.
The <unk> <unk> that, against <unk>, is about to get a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Now, unfortunately, this is a face that we see more often in the life of day, as we are <unk> about <unk> problems.
This is what I call <unk> "is not good at living."
And here I'm really, right now. You can see? Yeah. OK.
This is what I'm right in front of you. "
Here's a piece of <unk> in my neighborhood.
<unk>, California, where I took my <unk> about <unk> that we are better in <unk> games than in real life.
And that's a problem that many <unk> many <unk> have.
We think we're not as good in reality as we are in games.
And I mean, I don't mean that's a <unk> <unk>, even though this is a <unk>. We actually actually <unk> more in games than in real life, but when I'm telling me, and I'm talking about <unk> something that matters, inspired to <unk> and <unk>.
And when we're in the <unk> world, I think many of us become the best <unk> to help at some point at some point, the most likely to help at some point on the problem, the most likely to <unk> on a problem, so it's <unk> after a <unk> and to <unk>.
In real life, when we're <unk> with <unk>, when we're <unk> with <unk>, when we're <unk> with <unk>, most often don't <unk> us.
We <unk> our <unk>.
It <unk> <unk>, maybe <unk>, <unk> or <unk>.
<unk> don't have that kind of <unk> when we <unk>, they just don't exist in games.
So this is what I wanted to do when I finished my <unk>.
What in games is impossible to make sure that there's nothing we can do?
How can we take these <unk> in games and <unk> them to work in real life?
So I looked at games like <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is really a <unk> environment for <unk>.
And I started <unk> a few things that make <unk> <unk> so <unk> in online <unk>.
So the first thing is that, the <unk> <unk> <unk> from this <unk> online games, especially in the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> many <unk> that are <unk> to <unk> their world, right now.
But not any <unk>, but it's a perfect <unk> with your own <unk> <unk>. Right?
So, you can <unk> it to <unk>.
Don't give you a <unk> that you can't <unk>.
But that's the <unk> of what you can <unk>. So, you've got to be a lot of you.
But there's no <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>.
There's no <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
There are always something clear and important to do.
And they're also <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you for <unk> <unk> to <unk> your <unk> <unk>.
It's not something that's possible with <unk> in real life, this feeling that in your <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
And in addition, it's also this <unk> story, this <unk> <unk> story about why we are, and what we're doing.
And then we <unk> all this <unk> <unk>.
I'm going to have you heard of the growth <unk>, and <unk> one in <unk>.
It doesn't work like that's constantly <unk> in real life.
When I'm going to <unk> on this stage I'm not going to have <unk> <unk>, which is actually <unk> 20 to <unk> ideas.
I don't get this kind of <unk> in real life.
Now, the problem with <unk> online <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> is that it's so <unk> to be on the point to <unk> something <unk> all the time that <unk> us to <unk> all the time in these <unk> <unk>.
It's just better in reality.
<unk>, until now, in <unk> all the <unk> <unk> <unk> have spent <unk> million years <unk> problems in <unk>.
Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing.
It could <unk> as if it was a bad thing.
But let me put that in context: <unk> million years ago, it was the time that our human <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> was the first <unk> to the <unk> to the legs.
Okay, so when we talk about how much time we <unk> games, the only way we think about that, is, the only way we think about that, is to talk about this, it's an extraordinary thing.
But it's also right. Because it turns out that by <unk> so much time <unk> games, we really change what we are able to do as human beings to do.
We <unk> to a more <unk> and more <unk>.
This is true. I think.
So, <unk> in this interesting <unk>.
It was <unk> recently by a <unk> <unk> at <unk> University.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the country is going to be spent <unk> hours online games to have spent <unk> hours online games to age of <unk>.
Now, <unk> hours is a very interesting number of reasons.
First of all, for the children in the United States <unk> hours to be the number of hours that you're going to you're going to school in the class of <unk>, and when you can never <unk> from hours.
So we have a whole <unk> of education <unk> that's going on in which people learn as much about what it needs to be a good <unk> about everything else else.
And some of you probably would probably read the new book of <unk> <unk>, called <unk>.
So you'll have already heard his theory about <unk> theory on <unk>.
It's <unk> on <unk> research on <unk> research that tells if we can <unk> <unk> <unk> for hours of study, <unk>, to whatever to the age of <unk>, we're going to be <unk> on that subject.
We're going to be as good at anything we do as the biggest <unk> in the world.
And so, what we're looking at is a whole <unk> of young people who are <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So the big question is, "What's exactly becoming so good?"
Because, if we could tell that, we would have a human <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Here's the world are now now now now, at least an hour per day, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
These are our <unk> <unk>.
500 million people who are <unk> good at something.
And in <unk> <unk>, we will have another billion <unk> that are <unk> <unk> to whatever this is something.
If you don't know, it's coming.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> energy, and they are working on the basis of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> of the world, especially in India, China, Brazil, they can <unk> online.
They <unk> another billion <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
This is going to bring us to <unk> billion <unk>.
And so I began to think about what these games games do.
These are the four things that I discovered. The first is <unk> <unk>.
OK. So think about that as a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is the <unk> to <unk> immediately in front of a <unk>, <unk> with <unk> that we have a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They always thought a <unk> <unk> is possible, and it's worth always possible, and it's worth now.
The <unk> are not <unk>.
<unk> are <unk> to the <unk> of a powerful social <unk>.
There are a lot of studies that show us that we like people more if we <unk> a game with them, even if they <unk> us <unk> our <unk>.
And the reason is that there's a lot of trust to <unk> a game with someone.
We trust that someone will spend their time with us, that it's going to work on us, they will <unk> the same purpose, and that they're going to stay in the game.
And so, I <unk> a game with someone really <unk> <unk> and trust.
And as a result, we're building <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> that.
You know, there's a reason why <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> hours a week.
It's because <unk>, when we're <unk> a game, that we're even more <unk> <unk> <unk>, and when we're <unk> with friends.
We know that we're <unk> as human beings to do hard work and <unk>.
And the <unk> are <unk> to work hard all the time, if they <unk> work work hard work.
In <unk>, it <unk> sense.
I love to be <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk>.
So, just a little bit <unk> to help us see things in perspective.
So, we all know, the largest <unk> in the world.
The second largest <unk>, with almost <unk> <unk> is the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> million people use it every month.
They have <unk> more information about <unk> <unk> <unk> through the Internet than any other <unk> in the world.
They <unk> a <unk> story.
They <unk> a <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Okay, so we have this four <unk> <unk> that <unk> in one thing.
<unk> are individuals individuals and <unk> <unk>.
There are people who believe they are able to change the world.
And the only problem is that they think they're able to change the <unk> <unk>, but not even the real world.
This is the problem that I'm trying to <unk>.
It's a <unk> called <unk> <unk>.
His name is <unk>. He <unk> why people <unk> so much time and energy and energy and money in the world.
And he says, "We're <unk> at what's called <unk> was nothing less than a mass <unk> to <unk> and <unk> online <unk>."
He's a <unk>. So it's <unk>.
And he says, "It's not me -- I'm a game <unk>, and I'm <unk>.
But he says, that this actually has a sense of clearly because <unk> can get more in online <unk> than I can get into life.
They can have more powerful social <unk> in games than in real life.
They get better, and they get more <unk> in games than in real life.
So he's saying that now, he has a sense for <unk> to <unk> more time in the <unk> world than the real world.
Now, I'm <unk> that is <unk>, for a moment.
But it's not, in any case, a <unk> <unk>.
We need to start to make the real world more than a game.
And so I was <unk> <unk> from something that happened to <unk> years ago.
These are the <unk> <unk>, <unk> in the <unk> of a <unk>. Right?
So before we had extraordinary <unk> of <unk> had <unk> <unk>.
And these are the first <unk> of human <unk> <unk>.
And if you're <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk>, you might know this story.
which is the history of <unk> that invented <unk> and why.
<unk> said that <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, they were <unk> in <unk> <unk> at a moment of <unk>.
<unk>, it was so a big <unk> that the <unk> <unk> decided he had to do something <unk>.
People <unk> <unk>. People are <unk>.
It was a <unk> <unk>. They needed a <unk> <unk>.
So, <unk>'s <unk>, they invented <unk> <unk> and they <unk> a <unk> political political <unk> in all the <unk>.
One day, every one of them will <unk>.
And the next day, everybody is going to <unk>.
And they're going to be so <unk> about <unk> because <unk> are so <unk> and we <unk> in such a <unk>, that they will <unk> the fact that they didn't have what they do.
And so on the day, the <unk> <unk>, a day after, they will <unk>.
And <unk> with <unk>, they lived like this 18 years, <unk> of a <unk> <unk> on one day and <unk> games in the other.
Now, that's exactly exactly me, I think, the way we use <unk> today.
<unk> <unk> to the real world.
The <unk> <unk> to <unk> of everything that is <unk> in real environment, everything that is not <unk> to our lives and <unk> what we need in games.
But we don't have to <unk> here.
This is really interesting.
<unk> <unk>'s <unk>, after 18 years, <unk> didn't <unk>.
So the <unk> decided that they were going to <unk> a <unk> game.
They <unk> the whole <unk> in two.
They <unk> a <unk> game, and the <unk> got the <unk> to go into a <unk> <unk>.
They will <unk> <unk>.
And they're going to <unk> a new place to <unk>, and then they were <unk>, and they wanted to <unk> the <unk> of resources that were <unk>, and they wanted to <unk> the <unk> where they can <unk>.
Now, that sounds <unk>, isn't it?
But recently, the <unk> <unk> showed that <unk>, that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, had the same <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And so the <unk> <unk> that the story of <unk> <unk> might be true.
And <unk> have found <unk> about a global <unk> that <unk> about 20 years, and that would have been able to explain the <unk>.
So, this <unk> story could be true.
And they could actually <unk> their culture <unk>, to <unk> their culture games, to <unk> through the <unk> for years, and then to be so <unk> and to know so much about how to <unk> through games that way.
OK, we can do that.
We <unk> our <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> was the first <unk> game in real time in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>. That was 16 years ago.
They have <unk> <unk> games for 18 years, we have <unk> <unk> for 16 years.
I say that we are ready now for our own <unk> game.
Now they had half a <unk> who left to <unk> a new world.
So, this is where I'm <unk> billion hours of game a week.
We wanted to <unk> to <unk> half of us to <unk> a half of us to <unk> a half an hour a day video games until the real problems of life.
Now I know you're thinking, "How can we solve the real problems of life in games?" Well, this is the <unk> of my work in the last years to <unk> for <unk>.
We have this <unk> to our <unk> in <unk> <unk> and <unk> our <unk> about how to try to <unk> the future.
We don't want to try and <unk> the future.
What we want to do is to <unk> the future.
We want to <unk> our best <unk>.
And then we want to <unk> people to <unk> this <unk> in reality.
We want to <unk> our <unk> <unk>, and then give people <unk> to <unk> these <unk> <unk>.
I want to show you very <unk> three of the <unk> that we've done that is trying to <unk> people to create <unk> <unk> in their own <unk>.
So, that's the World <unk> <unk>.
I created this game in <unk>.
This is an online game that <unk> to <unk> a oil <unk>.
The oil <unk> is <unk>, but we put <unk> <unk> there so that you can think it's real, and to <unk> your life as if you can think it's real, and when you're in this game, you tell where you where you're telling where you where you're going.
And then you <unk> the <unk> video in real time <unk> data that shows you how much it costs, which is not <unk>, what it's not <unk>, how it's <unk> <unk> <unk>, if they're <unk>, if they're <unk>, if they're <unk>.
And you have to tell you how to <unk> your life if all these would be <unk>. And then you want to <unk> in a <unk> about this, to <unk> <unk>, to <unk> pictures.
I <unk> this game in <unk> with <unk> <unk>.
And I <unk> them three years since then.
And I can tell you that it's an experience that makes you.
<unk> wants to <unk> their own life because it's good for the world, or because it's good.
But if you put them in a <unk> <unk>, and you say, "We'll <unk> without oil."
This is a story and a <unk> <unk> in which to <unk> you.
Let's go back to see how you <unk>.
Most of our <unk> have been <unk> <unk> that they learned in this game.
So for the future game that can <unk> the world, we decided to <unk> the world, I would have decided to look at <unk> problems.
<unk> created a game called <unk> to <unk>.
And the <unk> was that a <unk> of <unk> that people were just <unk> years of spent on this planet.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, of course.
We've <unk> people to come online as a <unk> <unk> movie.
You know <unk>'s <unk> <unk>, a team of <unk>.
You have <unk>, <unk> science, <unk> <unk>, and they all have something to do to <unk> the world.
But in our <unk>, instead of having just five people in this team of <unk>, I said that we're all part of the team, and it's your <unk> to <unk> the future of the <unk>, the future of the <unk>, the future of <unk> and <unk> social future.
<unk> had <unk> people who <unk> this game for eight weeks.
They've invented 500 <unk> <unk> that you can see if we <unk> online and <unk> "<unk>" on Google.
So, in <unk>, the last game is <unk> it in three <unk>. This is a game that's a game created in <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>. If you can <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> Africa, and they were <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of social <unk>.
We have a <unk> <unk>. We have growth in <unk> to <unk> like <unk> <unk>, <unk> on <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> and the ability to be full of resources.
I'd like to <unk> you all of you to <unk> this game with young people anywhere in the world, especially in the developing areas that could <unk> from <unk> to try to <unk> their own social companies that would <unk> their own social companies that would <unk> the world.
So, now I'm going to <unk>.
I want to ask you something.
What do you think will happen now?
We all of these <unk> <unk>, we have these games that are sort of a <unk> <unk> <unk> of what we could do, but none of them have yet yet <unk> the world.
Well, I hope you will agree with me that <unk> are a human <unk> that we can use to <unk> for the real world, that the <unk> are a powerful <unk>.
We all have these amazing <unk>, <unk> <unk>, the ability to <unk> an <unk> of social <unk>, this feeling of <unk> <unk>, and <unk> to make a <unk> sense.
I hope from <unk> that we can <unk> to <unk> games that matter, to <unk> on this planet for another century.
And it's my <unk> that you're going to <unk> and <unk> games like this.
When I think about <unk> <unk>, I know two things are <unk> that we can create any <unk> future <unk>, and that we can <unk> whatever games we want.
So I'm saying, let's <unk> that change the world.
Thank you.
For some time, I'm interested in <unk> <unk>, which would seem <unk> for a <unk>, just if you think about it, which is, "something that I think about, which is," something that I think about <unk>, which is, "something that I think about, which is," something that I thought about <unk> by someone becomes a real thing. "
And he said, <unk> <unk> have an <unk> effect in certain kinds of studies, <unk> <unk>, just because the person thinks what's happening is a <unk> effect or <unk> --
To <unk>, for example, if it thought it was <unk>, in the body has a <unk> effect called <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> becomes something real because of the <unk> in which someone <unk> him.
To <unk>, I want to start by showing you a <unk> <unk>, a very simple <unk>.
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a <unk> that I <unk> in every book of <unk> for children still <unk>.
And I learned from <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
I'm going to show and then I'll explain it.
And then I'm going to explain why.
So here's what's going on.
<unk>, which you can <unk>; my hand, you can see it.
I'm going to <unk> in your hand like this.
I'm going to <unk> the <unk> up.
And in order to tell you that nothing goes or comes out of my <unk>, I'm going to <unk> here.
To see there's nothing on here.
As long as the <unk> <unk> <unk> there doesn't come out there and nothing out of my <unk>.
And it's pretty simple.
I'm going to open hand, and I hope, if everything goes well, my <unk> animal will just <unk> the <unk>.
In fact, it's so good that I can <unk> hand, and <unk> don't <unk>.
There's no <unk> to or <unk>, no <unk>. And you can <unk> everything.
<unk>!
The <unk> <unk> <unk> children on this <unk> <unk>, because you can <unk> a lot about <unk> <unk>, even if it's very simple to do.
<unk> many of you here are <unk> it already.
Here's what's happening.
<unk> <unk> in your hand.
And I say I'm going to <unk> my hand to <unk> me that there's nothing on there, there's a <unk>.
The reason I'm <unk> to <unk> is actually the <unk> of this <unk>.
In the moment, my hand is <unk> in front of the <unk>, and you don't see it, this <unk>, the <unk> will <unk> from where it is to a <unk> of this kind of <unk>.
<unk>.
On there is a child without <unk>.
So, that's how it works, here.
And as I <unk>, my <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And we can look at this in <unk>, why don't you know that there are just three <unk> here, because our mind, and the way that we <unk> <unk>, not <unk>, one, one, two, three <unk> <unk>. <unk> them.
But that's not all that's not that? And then you get your hand.
The <unk> of the <unk> are <unk> there, not by <unk>, but through a <unk>, I <unk> my <unk>.
And then when I was <unk> <unk>, the same thing, as I was <unk>, I was <unk> in a way of my <unk>.
I'm <unk> hand at one hand. And <unk>.
This is this guy can make <unk> and <unk>. <unk>.
Now, what is the <unk> <unk> <unk>?
I read one study, a year ago, who open my mind.
I'm not <unk> <unk>, so it was something amazing.
It turns out that if you <unk> a <unk> <unk> in the form of a <unk> <unk>, just a <unk> <unk>, it has a <unk> effect.
But if you look at the shape you <unk>, you give a little <unk>, you make a <unk> and <unk> on it, it has a higher <unk> effect.
<unk> no one of these <unk> don't have <unk> <unk> -- they're <unk> with <unk>.
But <unk> <unk> is not as good as <unk>.
How? This is <unk> me.
And yet it looks like there.
If you take <unk>, they're more <unk> than <unk>, in whatever form.
A <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> at the other end and the other is better <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And with <unk> is a <unk>.
A <unk> twice a day is not as good as <unk> as <unk> don't <unk> <unk> <unk> now. <unk>.
But the idea is that...
and <unk> matters.
And by also has something to do with that.
And if you want the <unk> effect has to go to <unk>.
<unk>? <unk>: A <unk> with a few <unk> <unk> of something <unk>, and I <unk> that in a <unk>...
So it's such a powerful picture for them, much more powerful than the <unk> <unk>.
It's real, this <unk>, well, I'm going to show another time when I'm going to have <unk>.
The idea is that the <unk> <unk> is not as good as the <unk> is not as good as a <unk>, and it's not as good as a <unk>.
And there's no <unk> quality quality.
It just <unk> our <unk> makes a real <unk> in our body and produce a <unk> effect.
And I wanted to see if I can <unk> this idea at a <unk> <unk>.
And let me take something that is obviously a <unk> <unk> and make it <unk> real.
And we know from that study that if you want reality, you have to <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> of seven <unk>. It's very <unk>.
And I'm going to <unk> it a little bit.
This is my hand. It's not <unk>.
This is my <unk>. There is no <unk> effect.
I'm going to <unk> <unk> and I'm going to share this <unk>.
If you're <unk> if you're <unk> with <unk> -- <unk> this for a few friends in the <unk> room, and there were some people who don't know, and I'm going to be <unk>.
So, I'm <unk> to you that if it's done <unk> to <unk> you in another part of the next <unk> actually, you know what, I'm not going to be the first part of view.
You're going to see, you're going to see if you want.
So, that's right here, right here, on the bottom of my <unk>, I'm going to do a little <unk>.
I'm sorry. Are you <unk>?
And now I go through <unk> a little bit, and I'm <unk> it on the other side like this.
Now, we're kind of at the same point as <unk> with <unk>.
That's like this.
But now you can't <unk> <unk>, <unk>?
Well, let me show you one, two, three, four, three, four, five.
Yeah, well...
I know what people think when I see this.
<unk>: "Well, it's not that <unk> to <unk> alone so that they can <unk> us a few minutes." Well, it takes a little.
What does that look like? <unk>.
Yeah, I know. And the <unk> will say, "OK. In fact, I don't have seen this" The <unk> right next to me now.
Let me show you better.
This really is my <unk>. It's not a special effect from <unk>.
This is my <unk>, and I can <unk> it.
I'm asking <unk>. If you're doing bad, <unk> in the other hand, you don't think about that.
And the <unk> or the <unk> are going to look at over over years, they would say, "It's okay, it shows pretty <unk> is a <unk> there, but if it would be real, if there, they would be a <unk> there and another blood.
<unk>, here.
<unk>, now I would <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> his hand, and I'm not a <unk>.
But I think in this context and I'm going to take something <unk> and turn it into something <unk>, I'm going to leave him there, and I'm going to leave him there, and I'm going to get it out there, and I'm going to <unk> it on.
We're going to see a few times <unk> days.
I hope I just <unk>. Thank you very much.
So I met a lot of <unk> in my life.
I just <unk> two.
The first was more as a <unk> business business.
It was a beautiful <unk>, full of <unk>, with <unk>, <unk>, a <unk> of <unk>.
<unk>.
Well, even better, it was <unk> at a <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
So you feel good when you're <unk> it.
I've been in a <unk> with this <unk> on the <unk> of many months.
And one day, <unk> <unk> <unk> me, and he asked me, if I would talk to a <unk> about <unk> <unk>.
"Of course," I said.
So here's a company trying to <unk> what this has become this <unk> problem for our <unk>.
How do we <unk> on our <unk>?
For the last 50 years, I've been <unk> in <unk> and <unk> as we <unk> the <unk>.
It's hard to <unk> <unk>.
<unk> percent of the sea, the one that we <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, all have <unk>.
<unk> they <unk>.
So, in good or <unk>, <unk>, they become part of our <unk>.
There are a lot of <unk> about <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, at least most of them do, and they <unk> <unk> <unk>, you see the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> has a <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
This means that we need 15 <unk> <unk> <unk> to get a <unk> of <unk> to get a <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
It's not too <unk>.
And <unk> doesn't have too <unk>.
So here, finally, it was a company that was trying to do it well.
We wanted to <unk> them.
On the day of <unk>, I <unk> the public <unk> in the company.
We call the <unk>.
"<unk>," I said, "just to put things at the point, you're <unk> because you're <unk> <unk> so far from the sea, that you're not <unk>."
"Right," <unk>. "We are so far from our <unk>, they're not <unk>."
And then he said, "We are actually a new <unk> world.
<unk> <unk> <unk>? <unk> to one, "<unk>.
"The best on <unk>."
<unk> to one, great.
"<unk> to one of what? What's food?"
"<unk> <unk>," <unk>. "
"<unk>," I said, "I've done it."
And that night, I was <unk> in <unk>, and I was thinking: What <unk> is a <unk> <unk>?
So the second day, even before <unk>, we <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I said, "<unk>, <unk> some examples of <unk> <unk>," He said he doesn't know. It's going to <unk> around.
Well, I've talked to the phone a few people in the company.
No one couldn't give me a clear answer.
<unk>, I've talked to <unk> <unk>.
We call him <unk>.
"<unk>," I said, "<unk> some examples of <unk> <unk>," Well, <unk> some <unk> and something <unk> <unk>, and then he said the <unk> <unk>.
I said, "<unk> <unk>?"
He said, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk> in food."
I said, "What's your <unk> in your <unk> is <unk>?"
<unk>, <unk>, about two percent.
"Well, it's about 30 percent," <unk>.
"<unk>, what is <unk> in <unk> <unk> with <unk>?" I said.
It was a long <unk> on the line, and he said, "simply, there are too many of them in the world."
My <unk> for this <unk> was <unk>.
No, because I would be an <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
In fact, I'm actually.
No, I've been <unk> by this <unk>, because it was like, <unk>, <unk> had <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
Second, it's another kind of story.
It's the kind of <unk>, in which, the better you <unk>, the more <unk> it.
<unk> we <unk> it to a <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> <unk> <unk> for a long time about this <unk>.
In a way we <unk> our <unk>.
She came to the table in a <unk>, <unk>, almost <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> took it too much too much.
<unk> twice.
<unk>, it was still <unk>.
Who can do it as a <unk> to have good <unk> after it was <unk> too much?
I can't, but that guy can.
We call the <unk>.
In fact, his name is really <unk>.
And no, he didn't <unk> the <unk> and he's not <unk> <unk>.
At least not the way you and we understand that.
He's a <unk> at <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk> in <unk> of <unk>.
It's the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> was in the hands of the <unk>.
They <unk> the <unk> in the area that was actually a <unk>.
They've created by <unk> <unk>.
They built this series of <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> the water outside the <unk>, back into the <unk>.
But they couldn't make it <unk> <unk>.
And <unk> was a <unk>.
He <unk> 90 percent of the <unk>, which for this place, a lot of <unk>.
So in <unk> a company called <unk> <unk> <unk> bought <unk>.
What did they do?
They <unk> the meaning of water.
They <unk> to <unk>.
Instead of <unk> the water, they used the <unk> to <unk> the water to go back.
They <unk> <unk>.
They created a <unk> <unk> of <unk> -- <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> -- and in this <unk> process and his company, they <unk> completely <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is incredible.
I mean, you haven't seen something like this.
You think about <unk> that is millions of miles away, and all you see are <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>, often <unk>.
I was there not <unk> with <unk>.
He's a <unk> guy, three parts of <unk> <unk> and a <unk> part of the <unk>.
All right? <unk> there is hard through <unk>, and I <unk> and <unk>, I <unk> up to the <unk>, and the <unk> were <unk> their <unk> <unk>.
Here he shows a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Now the <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And here he <unk> a <unk> in the <unk> that <unk> <unk> them.
We found that <unk> most of <unk> in <unk> <unk> in Africa.
I asked him how to become such a <unk> in <unk>.
He said, "<unk>? I didn't know about <unk>.
I'm <unk> in <unk>. "
And then they <unk> in more <unk> about <unk> <unk> and <unk> plants.
And let me not <unk>, it was really fascinating, you know, sort of a <unk> <unk> community.
It was great, but I was <unk>.
And I was <unk> after that piece of <unk> <unk>, <unk> too much, which I <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
So I <unk> him. I said, "<unk>, what are you doing?"
He's shown to <unk>.
"Yes, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, is amazing.
But what's your <unk> <unk>?
What is the rate of <unk>? "
Well, he started telling me that it's such a <unk>, that <unk> <unk> <unk> that would be <unk> and in <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, this <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is so <unk>, it <unk> itself.
It's not the other food.
Have you ever heard of a <unk> that didn't <unk> their animals?
And later on that day, <unk> <unk> through this <unk> with <unk>, and I said, "For a place that seems like this natural," For a place that seems like this natural, "<unk> to any other <unk> I've ever been," How do I'm going to <unk>? "
At that point, it was like the <unk> of a film would be asked to change the <unk>.
And I gave my <unk>, and I saw the most amazing <unk>, thousands and thousands of <unk> <unk> <unk>, a real <unk> <unk> as much as your eyes.
"This is <unk>," <unk> he.
"<unk> to their <unk> <unk>."
It's <unk>. "
<unk>? I was completely <unk>.
I said, "<unk>, but they don't get out of your <unk>?"
"Yes," he said.
"<unk> 20 percent of our <unk> and the <unk> <unk> because of <unk>.
Well, last year, this <unk> had <unk> <unk> on it, more than <unk> species.
Today, it became the <unk> and one of the most important <unk> <unk> in all Europe. "
That's I said, "<unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> is not the last thing you want on a <unk> of <unk>?"
<unk> the head, no.
He said, "<unk> <unk> <unk>, not <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
So the more <unk> is, the better the system. "
All right, let's <unk>.
A <unk> who are not <unk> their animals, and a <unk> that <unk> their <unk> through their <unk> health <unk>.
A <unk> <unk>, but also a <unk> of <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, those <unk> <unk>, not even should be there.
They <unk> in a city to <unk> <unk> <unk>, where <unk> <unk> are better to <unk> their <unk>.
In each of her <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
And every night, they <unk> the <unk> <unk> back.
They do that because they're able to <unk> the <unk> line of the <unk> <unk>.
It's not a <unk>.
I <unk> something like <unk> <unk>, so I looked at the <unk>.
I said, "<unk>, they <unk> the <unk> to the <unk>, and then they <unk> the <unk> <unk> back night?
Do they do that for their <unk>? "
And he looked at me as if I was <unk> from a <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
He said, "No. I'm doing it because <unk> is better."
I have no <unk> of my <unk> <unk>, which was <unk>, and I don't like the <unk> <unk>.
I don't like <unk>. I don't like <unk>.
It has that <unk> <unk>, like <unk>.
When I <unk>, I'm going to part of almost every time.
<unk>, when I <unk> to that <unk> in <unk> <unk>, had no <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> a <unk> <unk> and <unk> as if you took a <unk> of ocean.
I <unk> this <unk>'s <unk> and <unk>.
He said, "<unk> <unk> as a <unk>.
It's the <unk> in the way of anything that goes into the body.
It's <unk> to <unk> <unk>. "
And then he said, "But water doesn't have <unk>."
All right. A <unk> who don't <unk> their <unk>.
A <unk> who <unk> their <unk> through the <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And then I understood when he said, a <unk> that doesn't have a lot of <unk>, because the water that <unk> through the <unk> comes from <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that brings up with him all the things that I wanted to <unk> these days, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And when it goes through the system and <unk> it, the water is more <unk> than the <unk>.
<unk> is so <unk> that <unk> water.
So, it's not just a <unk> that don't <unk> their animals, not only a <unk> that <unk> his health <unk> <unk>, but a <unk> that is actually a <unk> of water, and not only for those <unk>, but also for you and for me.
<unk> when the water <unk>, she <unk> in her <unk>.
A <unk> in the ocean, I know, but I'm going to take it, and so you should do, because this story of <unk>, even though, it's <unk> <unk> <unk>.
You may say it's a <unk> for the future of good <unk>, no matter that we're talking about <unk> or <unk>.
What we need now is a new concept of <unk>, one in which <unk> really has good <unk>.
But for a lot of this is a little bit.
We are not <unk>.
We are <unk>.
We <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We're talking about <unk> <unk>.
We <unk> <unk>.
And when I think these are things that will <unk> the future of good <unk>, someone <unk> up and says, "<unk> <unk> <unk>, and I love <unk> <unk>, but how are you going to <unk> the world?
How are you going to <unk>? "
Can I be honest?
They like that question.
No, because there's no, it's already <unk> more <unk> than we need for the world.
One billion people will be <unk> today.
A billion -- this is more than <unk> before -- because of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> not because of <unk>.
Now, I don't like this question because it <unk> the <unk> of our <unk> system over the last 50 years.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> in <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and all of the <unk> <unk> asks, "How can if you <unk> more people with more money?"
This was <unk>.
It was <unk>.
It was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We should tell the name, a business in <unk>, a business that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that makes that <unk> possible.
This is not a business, and it's not <unk>.
Our <unk> <unk> is <unk> today not because of <unk> in <unk>, but because of <unk> in <unk>, not by <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk>, but by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk>, but <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, not to <unk>, but by <unk> <unk> <unk>, and not the <unk> of <unk>, but by <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Do you want to <unk> the world?
<unk> <unk>: How are we going to <unk> ourselves?
Or better, how can we create <unk> that allow <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> itself?
In order to do that, no longer <unk> to the <unk> model in the future.
It's very old, and it's <unk>.
It's a lot of <unk>, <unk> and cars, and it has no good <unk>.
Instead, look at the <unk> model.
This is the one that <unk> for billions of years of experience.
<unk> <unk>, <unk> like <unk>, <unk> like <unk>, <unk> that are not just <unk> for them, <unk> that <unk> instead of <unk>, <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> instead of <unk>, <unk>, <unk> that are <unk> <unk>, but <unk> in <unk>, because they are the people who are <unk> and <unk> in <unk>.
And if I really want to be honest, they're better than I ever would have.
You know, I'm <unk> with this, because if this is the future of good <unk>, she will be <unk>.
Thank you.
I grew up with a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
At the <unk> <unk> with <unk> at school for an hour, took one back and one <unk> every day.
And I was always <unk> by a book, a <unk> book, which <unk> my mind <unk> my mind to other <unk>, and I was always <unk> by the <unk> I had.
And -- you know, that <unk> <unk> also in the fact that I was not at school, I was out, by <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> water and <unk> and <unk> them back, under the <unk>.
I was a real <unk> in <unk> of <unk>.
But everything had to do with my <unk> to understand the world, to understand <unk> <unk>.
And my <unk> for <unk> really seemed that it was <unk> around the world around me, because of what was happening -- this was <unk> in the '<unk> -- <unk> a month, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> in our <unk> with <unk>'s <unk> <unk> that <unk> animals and places in a world <unk> that we couldn't be able to <unk> the <unk> before.
So, that seemed to be <unk> with all of the <unk>.
And I was a <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And I discovered that, because I didn't <unk> video games and I <unk> this <unk> of <unk> and all this <unk> of <unk> images in the media, had to <unk> these images in my head.
You all know, as children have to <unk> a book, and, through <unk> <unk> <unk>, to put something on the <unk> <unk> in our <unk>.
And so, my answer to all this was to <unk>, to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, all these things.
I was always <unk> at mathematics on <unk> <unk>.
That was because this <unk> had to find, sort of a way of <unk>.
And it was an interesting thing, <unk> <unk>'s made me very <unk> about the fact that there's a <unk> world, <unk>, right here on Earth.
I can't really go in a <unk> world, in an <unk> world, ever.
This <unk> seemed pretty <unk>.
But that was a world in which we could really go, just here, on Earth, and that was as <unk> and <unk> like whatever I had to <unk> those books.
So I decided that I was going to become a <unk> at the age of 15.
And the only problem with this was that <unk> in a little <unk> in <unk>, at <unk> miles away from the world's <unk>.
But I didn't let that actually <unk> me.
I <unk> my father to until found, finally, a <unk> class of <unk> in <unk>, New York, exactly next to <unk>, almost where we were.
And I actually became <unk> <unk> in a <unk> in <unk> in the middle of the <unk> in <unk>, New York.
And I didn't see <unk>, a real ocean for two years, when we moved to California.
<unk> then, on the <unk> of 40 years, I spent about <unk> hours under the water and 500 hours were in <unk>.
And I learned that <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>, and even <unk> less <unk>, I'm so <unk> to life that it's really beyond what we can imagine.
<unk> nature is so <unk> by <unk>, in <unk> with our <unk>, the human <unk>.
I'm completely <unk> from what I see when I do these <unk>.
And my story of love <unk>, and it's as powerful as powerful as it was <unk>.
But when I <unk> a <unk>, like <unk>, that was <unk>.
And this <unk> to be the best way to <unk> this need to tell the stories that I had to tell stories with <unk> <unk>.
And in <unk>, we <unk> <unk> <unk>, and so on.
So, the creation was the way to put <unk> and <unk> together. And that had sense.
And of course, the <unk> I <unk> to tell them were, "<unk>," <unk> "and" <unk>. "
And with "<unk>," I have my <unk> for <unk> and <unk> with <unk> <unk>.
That's the two <unk>.
The interesting interesting thing about "<unk>," which is the <unk> of a <unk> problems, which is to create this <unk> <unk> in the water, for which I <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>.
And that's led to the first <unk> that ever came out in a movie.
And even if the movie didn't do money, I should say that <unk> <unk> <unk>, I was <unk> to something extraordinary, which is that <unk>, global warming, was <unk> by this <unk> <unk>.
You know, it's the <unk> <unk> <unk> that any technology <unk> enough is impossible to <unk> <unk>.
They <unk> something <unk>.
And so that made me become very <unk>.
And I thought, "<unk>, this is something that needs to be <unk> in <unk> art."
So, in "<unk> two, which was my next, I took this much further.
<unk> with <unk>, we've created on the <unk> <unk> in that movie, the <unk> <unk> of how this <unk> effect.
And he <unk>. And we created it again.
And I had the same <unk> result.
We did something more money on <unk>.
So there's a <unk> between these two <unk>, <unk> in the fact that this is going to be a completely new, a new form of <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
In <unk>, I put the <unk> of a <unk> company, my friend <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is <unk> by <unk> and <unk> at that time, and I <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And the idea behind the <unk> was that we're going to <unk> over the <unk> <unk> and so on, and we will go directly into the digital <unk>.
And I really did that, what gives us a <unk> <unk> for a while.
But I was left behind the <unk> in the '<unk> in terms of <unk> and <unk>, in fact, for which company had been <unk>.
And I wrote this piece called "<unk>" which has had the role of <unk> things beyond what the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> on computer and more, with the <unk> of human <unk>, <unk> in <unk>.
And the <unk> <unk> to be completely <unk> in <unk>.
And the world was going to be <unk>.
But <unk> didn't work.
And people on my company, they told me that we're not going to be able to do that for a while.
So I put this idea at <unk>, and I made another movie about a big <unk> that <unk>.
You know, I went and <unk> to <unk> as "<unk> and <unk> on a <unk>."
They wanted to be a <unk> story of <unk> <unk>, a <unk> movie.
In <unk>, what I wanted to do was to <unk> me to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And that's why I made.
This is the truth. Well, <unk> does not <unk> that.
But I've <unk> them said, "We're going to <unk>. We're going to <unk>. We're going to <unk>.
We're going to use that in the beginning of the <unk>.
It will be very important. It's going to be a <unk> <unk> for <unk>. "
And I <unk> them to <unk> a <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. But it has to do with <unk> that your <unk> can create a reality.
Because we actually actually created a reality in which six months later, I was <unk> in a <unk> <unk> two and a half under the level of North <unk>, <unk> at the <unk> <unk> through a <unk>, not <unk>, on good.
Now, that <unk> me.
And it took a lot of <unk>, we had to build <unk> and <unk> and all sorts of things like this. But he <unk> me as much as this <unk>, this <unk> <unk> was the <unk> of an <unk> <unk>.
You know, where everything was powerful, and it <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> in this <unk>, you go to this <unk> environment and <unk> where there is no <unk> to be <unk> if you can't go back.
And I thought, "<unk>. <unk> live in a <unk> film.
This is really <unk>. "
And so I was really <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Of course, of course, by her <unk>.
It was everything. It was <unk>. It was <unk>.
And it was an experience that <unk> couldn't give me.
Because, you know, I couldn't imagine a <unk>, and I could create a <unk> effect for her. But I couldn't imagine what I was going through that <unk>.
So while I was looking at some of the <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> things that we've never seen before, <unk> things that no one has ever seen, which no one has ever seen, which wasn't <unk> at the moment that we have to <unk> and <unk> them.
So I was completely <unk> about that, and we had to have more.
So I took a pretty <unk> <unk>.
After <unk> <unk>, I said, "I'm going to put a <unk> of my <unk> <unk> and I'm going to become <unk> for a while."
And so I started <unk> these <unk>.
And we got to go to <unk> and <unk> it with <unk> <unk>.
We went back to <unk> <unk>.
We took little <unk> <unk> that I <unk> to have <unk> <unk>.
And the idea was to go inside and make a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, which has never been done before.
No one looked at the <unk> <unk>. They didn't have the <unk> to do that, so we created the technology to do that.
So, you know, <unk> on <unk> <unk>, in a <unk> and <unk> at the <unk> that we knew to <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
And it <unk> a little <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
When I say, I <unk> him, but my mind is in that <unk>.
I was <unk> by <unk>, I was <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it was the most <unk> in common experience that I've ever <unk>, because I knew before I had to <unk> a <unk> what's going to be there, before I wanted to <unk> it, because I was <unk> <unk> to <unk> it, because I was <unk> days when I was <unk> the movie.
And the <unk> was <unk> as a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
This was an absolutely <unk> experience.
And he made me really <unk> the <unk> <unk> that you can have with these <unk> <unk> <unk>, when your <unk> is <unk> in a <unk>, in this different form of <unk>.
It was <unk> a profound thing.
And maybe a short look on what might happen over a few decades, as we're going to start to have body <unk> for <unk> or other <unk> in many of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that I can imagine as a <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
So in these <unk> and <unk> to really <unk> what we found out there, down like these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where we discovered these amazing animals.
They're in <unk> <unk> that live here, on Earth.
They live in a <unk> environment <unk> <unk>. It's not <unk> in a <unk> system, so like us.
So you see animals that live next to <unk> water with <unk> 500 degrees.
You think it might not <unk>.
At the same time, I was interested in <unk> science, again, <unk> <unk> <unk> that we <unk> at the time.
And I got involved in the <unk> community, very involved with <unk>, in the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> in <unk>, <unk> by <unk> <unk> for <unk> and all these things, to walk through the <unk> <unk> for <unk> and all these things, to <unk> the <unk> <unk> with our 3D <unk> system.
And that was fascinating.
But what we've got to do is to bring people to <unk> with us in <unk>.
And by <unk> them down for them to have access, <unk>, <unk> scientists, who were <unk> by these <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> in <unk> and <unk> to see and take the <unk> to <unk> with <unk>, and so on.
So <unk> making <unk> <unk>, but in fact, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> completely <unk> of the <unk> of being <unk>, you know, as a child, and it's doing things on the good. And you know, on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk>, I've learned a lot.
I've learned a lot about science. But I also learned very much about art.
Now, you think that <unk> must be a <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and all these things.
I really really learned about art to <unk> until we did these <unk>.
Because I had, at some point, to say, "What are I doing here?
Why do they do that? What are I do? "
We don't do money with these <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. I don't bring any <unk>.
I'm kind of thinking I went to "<unk>" and "<unk>," and that I <unk> my <unk> somewhere, <unk> to the <unk>.
We've done all these <unk>, we've done all these <unk> for a very <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, no <unk>, without money. What are you doing?
You're going to do the work itself, for challenge -- and <unk> is the most <unk> environment, for <unk> <unk> and for <unk> that are <unk> when a small group of people form a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Because we <unk> these things with a team of <unk> people, <unk> years old.
<unk>.
And in this, <unk> that the most important thing is the <unk> that you have for them and that they have them for you, that you have done a job that you can't explain.
When you think about <unk>, and you say, "We had to do that, and <unk> <unk>, and the other, and the other, all technology has been <unk>, and <unk>, the <unk> of human <unk> to work on large, you can't explain it. It can't explain it. It can't explain to this, or people in <unk> areas that they can never <unk> it together, and I can never explain it.
There's a <unk>, a <unk> to <unk>.
So, when I went back to doing my next film, which was "<unk>," I tried to <unk> the same principle to drive, and that is to <unk> your team and <unk> them at the same time and their <unk>.
And it really changed <unk>.
<unk> again with a <unk> team, on <unk> <unk>, doing "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk> new technology that didn't exist until.
That's interesting.
<unk> <unk>.
And I became a family, on the <unk> of a four and a half years.
And that has changed all my way to make movies.
So people have <unk> <unk> in which, well, you know, you've brought up to life <unk> and <unk> on the planet <unk>.
For me, it was more a <unk> way to do business, the process itself, which has changed as a result of this actually.
So, what can we <unk> from that?
You know, what are <unk> <unk>?
Well, I think the first is <unk>.
It's the <unk> thing you've got.
<unk> is a <unk> that can really <unk> in a reality.
And the <unk> of your <unk> is more important than all <unk> in the world.
The <unk> of <unk> come to me and say, "<unk> a <unk> to do that."
And I tell them, "Don't <unk> you.
These people are going to do that for you, don't do it alone, not <unk> against you.
And the <unk> <unk>. "
<unk> has this <unk>: "<unk> is not a <unk>."
But <unk> has to be a <unk> in art and in <unk>, because it's a <unk> <unk>.
And no important <unk> that <unk> <unk> did not have done without risk.
You need to be <unk> to <unk> those <unk>.
So, this is the <unk> you <unk>, which is that in whatever you do, you get a <unk>, but <unk>, no. Thank you.
<unk> would let me with one important idea today, which is that the whole <unk> of data that I'm <unk> is bigger than the <unk>, and, instead of <unk> you can use the <unk> to the way that we can use the <unk> and see the <unk> that might be <unk>.
Now we're looking at a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> after <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that I'm using here is <unk>, it's called <unk>, and what I can do with him is that I can <unk> a cause of <unk>, <unk> for example.
I see how a different structure, different.
This is because here in the middle, people are in their most <unk>, and here because they become very <unk>.
We take a step back, and we look at the <unk>, we see that the <unk> <unk> and cancer are <unk> <unk>, but not all for us.
If we <unk> and <unk> after age, let's say about 40 years or less, we see that <unk> are actually the most <unk> <unk> to <unk> people.
And further, it's especially the case for <unk>.
<unk> that this <unk> way of <unk>, is as if you <unk> in a <unk> <unk> of information.
And if we can do that with simple data, why don't we do as well with <unk>?
Here we have <unk> <unk> <unk> number of <unk> <unk> that has <unk> to now.
They're all here. They're all on the Internet.
You can <unk> this home when you go from here.
With <unk>, you can <unk> certain <unk>.
<unk> years old.
You can move directly to a particular subject.
I look at this -- I see <unk> that came in this <unk> of <unk>.
I'm big <unk> <unk> <unk>, so I <unk> it, and that brings all the <unk> in which <unk> <unk>.
If I just want to look on them, maybe I think by my mind "<unk> to see what they have about <unk> in general?"
They go back, and I'm going to go back and <unk> that.
I see <unk> <unk> now.
And I'm <unk> that when you go through information in this way, when you <unk>, <unk>, you go back and forth, don't <unk>.
<unk> something a little different.
It's somewhere in the middle, and we think it changes the way it can be used <unk>.
I want to go a little further on this idea which is a little bit <unk>.
We took each page of <unk>, and we <unk> to a <unk>.
The <unk> is just a <unk> and a <unk> that <unk> <unk> in which you <unk>.
I'm just going to show you the first 500 <unk> right here.
But even in <unk>, we can do a lot of things.
We see what are the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
Now I'm going to <unk> <unk>.
Now I've <unk> <unk>, I can see the <unk> in <unk> who <unk> the most <unk>, which is the <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk>.
And that's important because it's a thing that wasn't <unk> a <unk> page.
You can find that just if you take a step back and look at all the <unk>.
<unk> all of these <unk> <unk>, I can then <unk> more <unk> <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk>, to bring them all in the <unk>.
And I look at these people, I see most of these people come from <unk>.
<unk> come from natural <unk>.
<unk>, and <unk>, come from business.
This is my <unk>.
And this comes from music.
And pretty interesting, <unk> is also a <unk> of TED <unk>.
So we're going to look at the TED <unk>.
You see, <unk> for the first time <unk> as if it really would be a <unk>, and not from the page, but on a <unk> level of <unk>.
And I want to show you one thing that can take you through <unk>.
I'm going to show you New York City.
<unk>, our <unk> -- I don't want to call it <unk>, because it's not really a <unk>, but you can see the web with it -- and we're using <unk> technology and <unk> in each page.
I can make a step back, let me go back to a certain <unk>.
Why it's important, because I just <unk> <unk> <unk> in this way, I can see the whole <unk> history in exactly the same way.
I can <unk> in <unk> what we've done in different <unk>.
This is actually the <unk> of this <unk> that we're doing now.
And I can look at things that I've done today earlier.
And if I want to do a step back and look at all I can <unk> my <unk> <unk>, for example.
Here I have <unk> for <unk>, here for the <unk> <unk>.
And this is where I can <unk> a page and <unk> it again.
It's a <unk> <unk> of many times, and in each case, it does the whole bigger than the data <unk>.
Now, in our world, we think data is a <unk> for us.
We are <unk> <unk> with information.
We think we're <unk> in data.
What if we're going to be able to go back and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>, so instead of <unk> from one thing to the next, we can go from many more to more things, and to be able to find the <unk> that are different?
If we do that, instead of being <unk> in <unk> <unk>, we could actually can <unk> information.
And instead of only have a <unk> <unk> <unk>, we could actually <unk> the <unk>.
And if you look at the <unk>, maybe it's <unk>.
That, thank you.
Everybody talks about happiness today.
I've <unk> someone to <unk> numbers who have the word "happiness" in <unk> were <unk> in the last five years and <unk> after about about 40. There are much more.
There's a <unk> <unk> <unk> for happiness among scientists.
It's made a lot of <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
Everybody would want to make people more <unk>.
But despite the <unk> <unk> in this field, there are a few <unk> <unk> that <unk> us to make a <unk> picture about happiness.
My <unk> today is going to make <unk> <unk> to these <unk> <unk>.
They are <unk> so <unk> to people who think about <unk> happiness, and the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, it seems that we're <unk> as <unk> as everyone else.
The first one of these <unk> is <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It looks like <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "no more is a <unk> word because we use it to many different things.
<unk> that there's a <unk> sense of which we could <unk> it, but <unk>, <unk>, we will have to <unk> at this <unk> and <unk> a more view of the <unk>.
The second <unk> is a <unk> between <unk> and <unk>: in fact, a <unk> between being <unk> in life and being <unk> in <unk> life, or being <unk> about <unk> life, or being <unk> about <unk> life.
There are two very different <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And the third <unk> is <unk> <unk>, the fact that we can't think about any <unk> that we can think about no <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And that's a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's just not <unk>.
I'd like to start with the <unk> of a <unk> of questions and answers at the end of a <unk> of <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
I knew I was <unk> a <unk>, and the music was absolutely wonderful.
But in <unk> <unk>, there was a <unk> <unk> and <unk>, pretty <unk>, that the <unk> was <unk> his whole experience.
In fact, it's not <unk> <unk>, but <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> 20 minutes of <unk>.
But they were zero to zero because what the <unk> was <unk>.
<unk> had been <unk>, and <unk> was all <unk>.
The <unk> here is that we are probably <unk> us and others like <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
There's a <unk> in the moment, and the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>, but in <unk> has just <unk>.
It's the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, when <unk> ask, "Are you <unk> when you go here?"
On the other hand, there are <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> is the one that <unk> <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of our lives.
It's the <unk> <unk> <unk> when they ask, "How do you <unk> in the last time?"
or "What was <unk> in <unk>?"
<unk> two are very different <unk>, <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> of them leads to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk>.
<unk> with the basic answer of our <unk>, it starts right now.
We don't just tell stories when you <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> tells us stories, more <unk>, what you want to <unk> from our <unk> is a story.
Let me start with an example.
There's an old study about <unk> that <unk> through <unk> experience.
It doesn't work in <unk>. It's not <unk> today, but it was <unk> during the 90.
They were asked to describe their <unk> every 60 <unk>.
We have here two <unk> and their <unk>.
The question is, "What's <unk> more?"
It's a very simple question.
<unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> more.
<unk>'s <unk> more.
But here's another question: How do we <unk> these <unk> <unk>? "
And here we have a <unk>: <unk> is that <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of these <unk> have been different because a <unk> part of the <unk> is how it <unk>.
The <unk> of the <unk> is not <unk> or <unk> <unk> one of them -- but one of them is obviously <unk> more <unk> than the other.
And the most <unk> was the way that the <unk> was <unk> to the end.
It's a <unk> story.
Where do we know?
I asked these people after <unk>, much later, how <unk> was <unk> in <unk>.
In their <unk>, it was much more <unk> for <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>, between <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
From a view of <unk> <unk>, it's clear that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> more.
What we could do with <unk>, A, and we've actually done <unk> experiments, which have <unk>, is to <unk> the <unk> <unk>. He <unk> in <unk> without <unk> him so much.
This is going to make <unk>, but a little bit, much less than before.
If we do this for two minutes, we <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, but the <unk> on the one of the <unk> <unk>, because now we left the <unk>. He had a better <unk> of his <unk>.
What's a story?
And it's the <unk> for the <unk> we <unk>, but also for the <unk> that we <unk>.
What's a story is <unk>, <unk> <unk> and the end.
<unk> is very, very important.
In this case, the end of the <unk> was <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of life.
<unk> moments of <unk>, and you think: What's happening with these moments?
And the answer is very simple.
They're <unk> forever.
Most of the <unk> of life -- and I <unk>: <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> three seconds.
We know that in life we have about <unk> million of these moments.
One month we have about <unk>.
Most of them don't leave any of them.
Most of them are completely <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
And yet, we've got <unk> that we should <unk>, that what's happening in these moments of <unk> is our life.
It's the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> during our <unk> on the ground.
And the way that a <unk> should be <unk>, but that's not the story that the <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
So we have <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>, which are <unk>.
Most of them is the way that it's <unk>.
From a point of view of <unk> <unk>, if you <unk> in <unk> and the second week is as good as the first one, <unk> two times more than a week.
For <unk> <unk>, things doesn't work at all that way.
For the <unk> <unk>, a <unk> of two weeks, it's better than a week, because they don't <unk> our <unk>.
<unk> wasn't <unk>.
So, the time it becomes the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> has a <unk> impact on <unk>.
<unk> <unk> does not only do to <unk> and tell stories.
It's actually the one that makes decisions because if a <unk> had, for example, two <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> that he <unk>, the <unk> will be the <unk> <unk> <unk> is less <unk> <unk> is less <unk>, less <unk> that <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> has nothing to say in this <unk>.
We don't actually <unk> in between <unk>, but between <unk>.
And even when we think about the future, we don't think about the future as a set of <unk>.
We think about our future as a <unk> <unk>.
And in <unk> you can <unk> that, as a <unk> of <unk> <unk>, and you can <unk> the <unk> as something that <unk> after he <unk> the <unk> by the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> doesn't need.
We <unk> that when we go to <unk>, and that's happening very often, we go into <unk>, in a very large, in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
And that's kind of hard to <unk>, I think.
I mean, how many new <unk>?
This is one of the things that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And when I think about this, I think about a <unk> that I've been <unk> in <unk> a few years ago, which was clear the most beautiful <unk> I've been <unk> and I think about it quite a lot, to how much I think about other <unk>.
And I've probably <unk> the <unk> of that <unk> three weeks to say for the last four years.
If I would have open <unk> <unk> with those pictures, I would have spent another hour.
So we have, on one hand, three weeks and, on the other hand, the <unk> for an hour.
There was a <unk>.
I could be a little bit extremely <unk> <unk> to my <unk>, but even if I <unk> them in a bigger <unk>, the question <unk> the question <unk>.
Why do we <unk> so much <unk> through <unk> with <unk>?
<unk>, I'd like to <unk> you to an experiment experiment.
You know that in your next <unk>, you know that at the end of the <unk> all of your <unk> will be <unk>, and that I'm going to <unk> a drug that would not be <unk>.
How do you choose the same <unk>?
And if you get another <unk>, there is a <unk> between <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and you need to tell this <unk>, and you have to tell this <unk>, and in fact it's not easy because if you <unk> the time as a <unk>, you will have an answer.
And if you look like <unk>, you might have another answer.
Why are they <unk> the <unk> they <unk>?
This is a problem that we're <unk> with a <unk> between <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> are doing <unk> at two different <unk> of happiness.
There are actually two <unk> of happiness that we can <unk>, one for each one.
So you can ask: How <unk> is <unk> <unk>?
And on the other hand: How <unk> are <unk> in <unk> life?
And they're all <unk>.
It's a pretty complicated process.
What are the <unk> that can be <unk>?
And, <unk>, now we are <unk> to make a pretty good idea about <unk> happiness <unk> over time.
Instead, the happiness of <unk>, is a completely different thing.
It's not about how happy a person <unk>'s life.
<unk> about how <unk> times <unk> is this person when it <unk> to his life.
It's a very different <unk>.
Who doesn't do the difference between these <unk>, will <unk> <unk> <unk>, and I have a group of <unk> scientists who have <unk> the <unk> <unk> for a long time in this way.
Many of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> has been <unk> over the last few years, and they're now doing <unk> to measure both <unk>.
<unk> <unk> makes a <unk> <unk> <unk> at a level of <unk>, in which better than half a million people have been <unk> what they think about their life and their <unk>.
And they've been done other similar <unk>.
So in the last few years, I started <unk> some things about the two types of happiness.
And I think the <unk> <unk> that I have, is that they're different <unk>.
You can tell how <unk> are some of their life, and that's actually not <unk> much about how <unk> they are in their life, and <unk> <unk>.
Just to give you one example of <unk>, <unk> is about the <unk> of this as if you ask someone and <unk> is saying, "Oh, <unk>'s <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>." <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. "<unk> <unk> much of this person?
<unk>, you've got something about his <unk>, but there was so <unk> <unk>.
If you say, someone's <unk> <unk> <unk> at eight on a <unk> of <unk> had <unk> about <unk> <unk> are with <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>.
I'm talking about what the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that money are very <unk>, <unk> are very important.
It means that happiness is more likely to be <unk> with people that we like, to <unk> time with the people that we like,
<unk> other <unk>, these <unk> are <unk>.
So if you want to <unk> the second self, the <unk> <unk> to <unk> different things.
<unk> to what I said here is <unk> that we should really be <unk> about happiness as a <unk> for <unk>.
It's a completely <unk> <unk>.
Now, very quickly, another reason why we can't <unk> <unk> about happiness is that we don't think about <unk> things that we don't <unk> to <unk> things <unk> our lives and when we're actually <unk>.
<unk>, if you put a <unk> <unk> about how many people are in California you won't get to the right <unk>.
You put that <unk>, you think that people need to be more <unk> in California if, for example, you're in <unk>.
And what's happening is that when you think about the <unk> in California, you go back to the <unk> of California and other places, and the fact that this <unk> is, for example, <unk>.
But it turns out that <unk> isn't really important for <unk> <unk> and it's not very important for <unk> <unk> and it's not very important for <unk> <unk> that people are.
But because of <unk> like <unk> <unk> is at <unk> you might get -- some people could get to <unk> in California.
And it's pretty interesting to understand what's going to happen to be more <unk>.
So, their <unk> <unk> will not become <unk>.
We know that.
But one thing is going to <unk>. They think they're more <unk>.
because when they look at this, the <unk> will <unk> as <unk> as a time in <unk>. And they'll feel like they took the good <unk>.
It's very difficult to think about <unk>, and I hope I gave you a picture about how hard it is.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have a question for you.
Thank you very much.
Now a few <unk>, when I talked to your phone, you know, you know, <unk>, you know, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
You know, like you can <unk> this because you have more minutes?
<unk> <unk>: <unk>.
I think the most interesting result of <unk> <unk> is a number that we haven't <unk> at all.
That's what we found is <unk> in <unk> happiness.
We looked at how <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
It looks like a <unk> came under a <unk> dollars a year, for <unk>, and this is a large number of <unk> <unk>, about what a big <unk>, under a <unk> <unk> dollars a year...
CA: <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> dollars a year, people are <unk>, and they become more <unk> <unk> on what this level is that the poor <unk>, <unk> an absolutely <unk> line.
I mean, I've been able to see a <unk> like this.
So it's clear that money doesn't bring the <unk>, but it's <unk> to their <unk>, and we can <unk> this very, very exactly exactly.
In terms of each other, <unk> <unk>, we have to do with another situation.
You know, the more money you are.
This is not true for <unk>.
CA: But <unk>, the whole <unk> is about <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
If the world took <unk> <unk> <unk>, I want to say, everything seems to be on the <unk> of what we think, for example, <unk> <unk> and so on.
Is there a lot of people like <unk>, like <unk> in general, to take this kind of <unk> and <unk> in the public field on it?
<unk>: <unk>, I think there's a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> will be <unk> in <unk>, <unk>, but in <unk>, is happening, and in other countries are happening.
People realize that they should be <unk> at <unk> when they think about public <unk>.
It's going to think about whether they want to <unk> happiness, or whether they want to <unk> happiness, or whether they want to <unk> <unk>, so we have to have this pretty soon, because to <unk> happiness, there are different <unk>, in <unk> as we think, and if we think about <unk> <unk>.
This will <unk> <unk>, I think, in the <unk>.
In <unk>, they make <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. And I think, in the next or the two <unk>, a part of the <unk> <unk>. There's a part of the <unk> that's going to be, or at least it should be, at least it should be, or at least it should be, or at least, it should be, or at least, in <unk>.
Thank you very much because you've invented <unk>.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk today about energy and <unk>.
And that might seem a little bit surprising, because my work with my whole <unk> about <unk> is <unk> <unk> and <unk>, by the things that we need to <unk> and <unk> to help the most poor two billion to <unk> better.
But <unk> and <unk> are extremely important for these people, even more important than anyone else on the planet.
<unk> <unk> means that many years of their <unk> will not grow.
It's going to be too much <unk>, it's not going to be <unk> <unk>.
<unk> are going to change in ways that their environment just can't <unk> them can <unk>.
And that leads to <unk>. <unk> to <unk>. <unk> to <unk>.
<unk> <unk> will be <unk> for them.
<unk>, <unk> <unk> is very important for them.
In fact, if we could choose one thing to <unk> them to <unk> the <unk> to reduce the <unk>, we choose the energy.
Well, the <unk> <unk> <unk> in time.
Right, <unk> <unk> is <unk> on <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and even in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and that's why we have <unk>, <unk> <unk>, we can create <unk> and <unk> things.
And so we are in a wonderful <unk> in terms of <unk> in the <unk> world.
But once we do more <unk> -- and try to do it, and try to do it two times more <unk> -- we need to <unk> a new <unk>, and this <unk> has to do with <unk>.
<unk> <unk> planet, and <unk> <unk> to <unk> is even a very simple one.
If you look at the <unk> <unk> <unk>, that leads to a <unk> growth, and the growth <unk> to some very <unk> effects.
<unk> on <unk> and, perhaps more <unk>, <unk> <unk> so that natural natural natural <unk> can't <unk> these <unk> changes, and so it gets to the <unk>.
Well, the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> between <unk> and <unk> growth and where there are <unk> <unk> <unk>, still have a <unk> <unk>, but not very much.
And there are certainly <unk> about how <unk> these <unk> are going to be extremely <unk>.
We asked scientists <unk>, in <unk> <unk>: Do we really need to get close to zero?
Can't we go to half or a <unk>?
And the answer is, until we will never get close to zero, the temperature will continue to grow.
So we have a big problem.
It's not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> that needs to <unk> under a <unk> of three feet, and that we might kind of <unk> that we could kind of <unk> to <unk>.
Here we have something that's <unk> to zero.
Now, we <unk> a lot of carbon <unk> every year, over <unk> billion <unk>.
For every American there are about 20 <unk>.
For people in <unk> countries is less than a <unk>.
<unk> on average average planet is about five <unk> for each human.
And, somehow, we need to do change that in zero.
It has <unk>.
<unk> different changes have made a <unk> <unk> <unk>, so we need to go from a <unk> <unk> to <unk>, and <unk> to zero.
<unk> has four <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
So, we have something on the left, <unk>, which we want to be at zero, and that's what's going to be <unk> on the average, energy for every single <unk> and <unk> on <unk> of energy.
Let's look at each of them and see how we can get to zero.
<unk> one of those numbers are going to have to <unk> enough.
Well, that's from <unk> <unk>, but let's get a look.
First, we have <unk>.
Well, the world has <unk> today <unk> billion people.
<unk> to nine billion.
Now, if we do a <unk> job with new <unk>, health and <unk> <unk>, we could <unk> this with maybe 10 or 15 percent, but here we see a <unk> growth of about <unk>.
The second <unk> are the <unk> that we use.
This <unk> everything, the food that we <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> are very good things, and <unk> of <unk> is to give these services on the planet.
And it's a great thing that number to grow.
In the world of <unk>, maybe in the first billion, we might be able to <unk> and use less, but every year, this <unk>, on average, will grow, so, in general, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> people will grow over twice.
Here we have a very <unk> service.
How many light in the home to you could <unk> your <unk>?
Well, these kids don't have, so they go out and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> from the <unk>.
And then the <unk>, it's energy for each service, here we have a lot of good <unk>.
We have something that doesn't grow.
By different <unk> and ways of <unk>, through different types of cars, different kinds of cars, there are a lot of services where you can reduce the energy for that pretty <unk>, in the case of services, even by 90 percent.
There are other services, for example, how we do <unk>, or how we do <unk> <unk>, where it's much less place for <unk>.
So, on average, if we're <unk>, you might <unk> a <unk> of three to, maybe six times.
But for these three <unk> of now, we get from <unk> billion to <unk>, maybe 13 billion <unk>, maybe 13 billion <unk>, maybe 13 billion <unk>, and that's not enough.
So let's look at the <unk> <unk> -- this is going to be a key <unk> -- which is going to be a key <unk> -- which is the <unk> <unk> on the energy <unk>.
And the question is, can actually <unk> it to zero?
If you <unk> <unk>, no.
If you <unk> <unk>, no.
<unk> every way to produce <unk> today, with <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What we need to do on a global scale, is to create a new system.
So, we need <unk> of <unk>.
Well, when I use <unk> <unk>, I don't mean something that's impossible.
<unk> is a <unk>. <unk> personal is a <unk>.
The Internet and <unk> are a <unk>.
People here have <unk> to create a lot of <unk>.
<unk>, we don't have a term to <unk> a <unk> to once.
<unk>, just like <unk>, and some of these things are not.
This is a case in which we really have to <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk> in a pretty <unk>.
So I thought, how would I could <unk> the idea?
Are there any <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> that might <unk> people?
And I thought, last year I've brought the <unk>, and it looks like.
It's really <unk> in the idea that, you know, there are people who live with <unk>.
Well, with the energy, what we could find was this.
I thought I'd like to give the <unk> <unk>, and that to be my <unk> in here in this year.
So here we have some <unk> <unk>.
<unk> said that it didn't <unk>. In fact, you might have no <unk> in the <unk>.
Well, there's all sorts of <unk> <unk> like this, but they don't know what value.
We need <unk>, one or more, who have this incredible scale, and they're <unk> <unk>, and even though people <unk> in many <unk>, I see only five to <unk> numbers.
We left the <unk> energy, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
They may be able to <unk> the <unk>, and if they will <unk> my <unk>, the better.
But what I want to <unk> here is that we're going to have to work on each of these five, and that we can't <unk> at all of them even if they seem <unk>, because all the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Let's look first at the <unk> <unk> <unk>, whether it's <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What we need to do here, it seems simple, but it's not, it's to take <unk>, after we <unk> it, and it's going to be able to <unk>, to put it somewhere and hope, to be there.
Now we have some <unk> stuff that make this at the level of 60 to 80 percent, but growth to the <unk>, that's going to be very difficult, and it's going to be hard, and it's going to be hard, and it's going to be hard problem.
Who's going to be sure?
Who's going to <unk> something that is <unk> billion times more than any kind of <unk> you can think about, <unk> or another way?
It's a very big <unk>.
It's a hard problem.
<unk> would be <unk> energy.
It's got three big problems.
<unk>, especially in <unk> countries, it's big.
The problem of <unk>, to be <unk> that nothing can happen, that, even though there are these <unk> <unk>, the <unk> will be used for weapons.
And then what do you do with <unk>?
And even if there are not many, many of us <unk> that.
People have to go well in <unk> with that.
So there are three very <unk> problems that might have <unk>, and so we should work on them.
<unk> three of the five of them, we put them together.
These are the ones that the world called <unk> <unk>.
But they -- even if it's great that they don't need <unk> -- they have some <unk>.
One is that the <unk> of these technologies is much smaller than a <unk> <unk>.
These are <unk> <unk>, we're talking here about many <unk> <unk>, a thousand times higher than a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
These are <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> didn't <unk> all day, and I don't <unk> every day, and the <unk> didn't know all the time.
If we <unk> these <unk>, we have a way to get energy in those <unk> when she's not <unk>.
Here we have big problems.
We have <unk> <unk>.
For example, let's say that a source of energy is out of <unk>, you don't need to <unk>, but you have to <unk> you and <unk> to <unk> the energy to <unk> <unk>.
And finally, there's the problem of <unk>.
And in order to understand <unk>, we've got all the <unk> <unk> that are products, for cars, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, whatever.
I <unk> with the <unk> of energy that we <unk> the world, and I found that all the <unk> that we <unk> could now <unk> less than 10 minutes of energy <unk>.
So, in fact, we need a <unk> <unk> here, a hundred times better than what we have now.
It's not easy, but it's not easy.
And the problem is, when we want <unk> <unk> to be over, let's say, 20, 30 percent of the <unk>.
If we <unk> on it for 100 percent, we need a <unk> <unk>.
Now, how are we going to go further, which is the right way?
Is it an <unk> <unk>? What can we help us get there?
Well, we need a lot of <unk> to work on this, hundreds.
Every of these five <unk>, we need at least 100 people.
And in many of them you will look, and you tell you they're <unk>. That's good.
I think here in TED <unk>, we have a lot of people who already are on this way.
Bill <unk> has a few companies, between which called <unk>, which has some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in tens of companies that make things <unk> and they have interesting <unk>, and I'm trying to <unk> it.
The <unk> <unk> and I actually <unk> a company that can <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> path.
There are some <unk> in the field of <unk>: <unk>, <unk>.
But the <unk> actually <unk> in this field a lot of time, and so there wouldn't be good ideas on somewhere.
The idea of <unk> is that, instead of <unk> a part of the <unk>, that one percent that is <unk>, we decided to <unk> those <unk> percent.
It's a <unk> idea.
In fact, he's been talking about her for a long time, but he never couldn't.
Just because the <unk> of modern modern <unk> now can <unk> and see that, indeed, using <unk> <unk> <unk>, it seems to be <unk>.
And because the <unk> <unk> percent, <unk> <unk> is a lot of <unk>.
In fact, the <unk> <unk>, and we can use it as <unk> all <unk> <unk> from today.
Instead of making <unk> for them, we use them. It's a great thing.
<unk> <unk> as we <unk>. It's like a kind of <unk>.
You can see here a kind of <unk>, called "<unk> <unk> <unk>."
What we're doing, this is really the problem.
I have a picture of a place in <unk>.
These are <unk>, the <unk> percent <unk> after the <unk> <unk> now.
It's called <unk> <unk>.
<unk> energy <unk> of the United States for hundreds of years.
And by <unk> the <unk> of water in a <unk> process, we would have enough for the whole life of the planet.
So we're <unk> a lot of <unk>, but it's an example of hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to <unk>.
Let's think, how can we <unk>?
How should we look at our <unk> <unk>?
Well, let's see where we have to go, and then look at the <unk> <unk>.
You've heard a lot of the world talking about this <unk> of 80 percent.
It's very important to get there.
And those 20 percent are going to be <unk> why is happening in <unk> countries and <unk>.
So let's hope that we will be <unk> <unk>, <unk>.
In order to get to the 80 percent, <unk>, countries like China, they have to <unk> their <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is if we <unk> this technology with zero <unk>, if we <unk> in all <unk> countries, and we're in the course of it.
This is <unk> important.
This is a key <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> a step back: how should look <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>?
Well, again, they should have two <unk>.
We should <unk> these <unk> <unk> to start to have <unk>.
The less <unk> you have, the less <unk> will be <unk> and, so that, the more <unk> temperature <unk>.
But in a way, the <unk> that we <unk>, doing things that don't go to the big <unk>, is just <unk> or maybe even less important than the other, which is the <unk> <unk> of these <unk>.
These <unk> have to <unk> speed, and that we can measure in <unk> with companies, <unk> <unk> and <unk> that have been <unk>.
<unk> wrote a lot of <unk> books on this <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, "our book" <unk> "and" <unk> <unk> <unk> -- without <unk>. "
They take everything in hand and they create a structure so that the world can talk about these things, because we need a <unk> <unk> <unk> for that.
It has to be a lot of things to be <unk>.
It's a <unk>.
It's a very <unk> <unk> to <unk> this technology.
If I could just <unk> a <unk> for the next 50 years, I could choose who would choose to be <unk>, I could choose a <unk>, which I could choose a <unk>, or I could <unk> that: energy at half <unk>, without <unk>.
I <unk> that I would <unk>.
It has the <unk> impact.
If we don't think about this <unk>, <unk> between people who think over the short term and in the United States and China, between <unk> countries and China, between <unk> countries and <unk> countries, and especially the <unk> countries, and especially the <unk> of those two billion people are going to be much more <unk>.
What do we need to do?
What do you want to do further and <unk>?
We need more <unk> of research.
When the countries <unk>, for example, they shouldn't just talk about <unk>.
We should talk about this <unk> plan.
<unk> <unk> how little <unk> are <unk> for these <unk> <unk>.
It needs and <unk> market, <unk> on <unk>, <unk>, so that they can get heard of the <unk> <unk>.
We need to <unk> <unk>.
We need this <unk> to become more <unk>, more <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> that the government takes.
It's an important <unk>, but I think we can <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. So to understand better about <unk>, first, you can give an idea of <unk>?
Bill <unk>: To make <unk>, <unk> <unk>, to <unk> <unk>, <unk> scientists, which I've done, are just tens of millions.
Even after we <unk> our <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk>, to be <unk> that our <unk> works, we're going to get hundreds of millions.
<unk> <unk> is the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> a few billion, of the <unk> <unk> <unk> of these.
After the <unk> <unk> on the first, if it goes like <unk>, then it's clear that <unk>, because the <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, they're very different from the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
CA: So to understand how we need, that <unk> <unk> in the ground, to a kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, by this type of <unk> <unk>, and then the process starts from the top, and then the process begins to go down?
<unk>: Well, it's time, we have to <unk> <unk>, that there are many people and many devices that can <unk>, instead of <unk> and <unk> objects in and outside.
That's not good.
If you have very cheap <unk> that you can <unk> there for 60 years -- we can <unk> it with a <unk> -- you can <unk> it, and you don't have the same <unk>.
It's just sitting there and <unk> for 60 years, and then it's ready.
CA: It's a <unk> <unk> that is also its own <unk> of <unk>.
<unk>: Yeah. Well, what's happening with <unk>, you can leave them there -- a lot more <unk> in the way -- and then you can even take them in the other way.
And we start with <unk>, which is now now now now in <unk> <unk> or <unk> in <unk> next to <unk> next to <unk>.
From this <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that's a problem for these <unk> is actually <unk> <unk> for our <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> through this process.
CA: But in <unk> with <unk> people around the world from all about <unk>, where did you find the <unk> <unk> to do something <unk>?
<unk>: I have no <unk> place, and there are all these rules of <unk> <unk>.
We're interested in a lot that people in the company have led to <unk>, India, China.
I met here with <unk> <unk>, and I talked about about the place in <unk> <unk>.
They're <unk>. Let me know that <unk> and <unk> did something.
This is a <unk> of something that already done.
It's an important development, but it's like a <unk> <unk> and many countries, and so any of the countries that have built a <unk> <unk> can be the first one of them.
CA: What <unk> you have, when and what the <unk> is going to happen?
<unk>: For one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that's very cheap, we have 20 years to <unk> it, and then it's 20 years to <unk> it.
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the environment showed us that we need to <unk>.
And the <unk>, if things go well, which is a big <unk>, you could <unk> the <unk>.
Now there is, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, we need to be hundreds, which also if their <unk> goes well, if the <unk> of their <unk> goes well, they can <unk> for that.
And it's better if we <unk> more, because then we could <unk> things.
We need one to <unk>.
CA: So, like <unk> <unk> <unk>, is this the largest that you <unk>?
<unk>: A <unk> <unk> is the most important thing.
It would have been even without the environment, but it's <unk> to do it.
In the <unk>, there are other <unk>.
You know, they don't <unk> their work as well as this, but there are the people who go on <unk>, which is another way.
There's also a <unk> <unk> <unk>, which seems a little bit difficult, but maybe they tell us the same about us.
So there's a <unk>.
<unk> is that a <unk> <unk> has a million times more energy than to say, one of <unk>.
So if we can solve the <unk> <unk>, which is in <unk> <unk>, then <unk> <unk>, as a effect on <unk> and so on, it's almost form a <unk> class of one.
CA: But if it's not going to <unk>?
<unk> we need to start <unk> <unk> to <unk> the temperature of the <unk> <unk>?
<unk>: If you get to this is like, when you're <unk> too much, and you're about to have a <unk> <unk>.
Then what do you do? It can need <unk> <unk> or something like that.
There's a research <unk> in what's called <unk>, which <unk> different <unk> of <unk> <unk> with 20 or 30 years, until we <unk>.
But that's just a <unk> <unk>.
We wanted to have no need it.
Some people say that we don't even have to work on <unk> <unk>, because we could do <unk>, that we will continue to <unk> because we know that we're going to <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
I don't think this is <unk>, having <unk> <unk>, but there's a lot of <unk>, if we shouldn't <unk> <unk> in <unk> in case that things were <unk> or if this <unk> goes much <unk> or if this <unk> goes much <unk> than we <unk>.
CA: <unk> <unk> <unk>: in a <unk> or two, what would you say to them that <unk>?
<unk>: From <unk>, <unk> <unk> different <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> are very <unk>.
<unk> that there are <unk> effects of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> things?
There are very, very <unk> things I can tell.
They have a million to be right.
The problem here is about AIDS.
<unk> <unk> now and <unk> for it much later.
When you have all sorts of <unk> problems, the idea is to <unk> now to have a <unk> later, and the <unk> is sort of <unk>.
We actually have <unk> <unk>, which is not <unk> the worst, and there are people in the <unk> world that's looking at the <unk> and say, it's <unk>. It's not that big.
In fact, we're just going to have to <unk> to that.
But my <unk> here is to <unk> a <unk> <unk> and <unk> to <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and then <unk> will say, well, I don't care that I'm not <unk> <unk>, I just wanted to <unk> the <unk> <unk>, but I'm going to <unk> it because it was <unk> than before.
CA: So that would be your answer to <unk> <unk> <unk>, which says if it's <unk> <unk> energy to solve the problem, no longer for the other <unk>, to try to <unk> the world of <unk>, <unk> and others, to try to <unk> the world of <unk>, <unk> and other things, that we're <unk> money to do.
<unk>: In fact, <unk> <unk> for <unk> and development -- to say that the United States should be <unk> with 10 billion a year more than now -- they're not really so <unk>.
<unk> <unk> other things.
The <unk> that you <unk> a lot of, and here are <unk> can't agree, is when they wanted to <unk> something <unk>.
This, for me, it's <unk>, in the <unk> of the situation when you're close, and just <unk> to become very cheap.
I think we should try more things that have <unk> to be much more <unk>.
If we get to the <unk> to make <unk> energy, then the <unk> can <unk> to <unk> that.
Many of us here could <unk> five times as much on energy without us to change our <unk> of life.
<unk> is for those two billion.
And it really changed.
His question is now: Why don't they <unk> more about research?
Because of what's past is still <unk> with <unk> <unk>, but he realized that it's a pretty <unk> <unk>, so he's a pretty <unk>, so he's the problem.
It's a <unk> of something right, I think.
<unk> research and development, it's a <unk> of how bad it is.
CA: Bill, <unk> I'm talking about in the name of the most of here when I say that you <unk> to <unk> your <unk>. Thank you very much.
<unk>: Thank you.
I want to share with you a few months ago, while I'm <unk> a <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
When I write, I always <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
But I was already <unk> by writing <unk>, and I realized that I had never <unk> the word "<unk> in <unk>.
Let me <unk> you.
"<unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
I read the <unk> of a friend, and I <unk>.
It was <unk>.
After <unk>, I got my voice, and I had to <unk> to <unk> my voice, and I had to <unk> me from these words <unk>.
It was my old <unk>.
I thought, maybe it was <unk> <unk>.
But it came out of <unk> in the early '<unk>, when I was <unk> <unk> and <unk> to understand where I was <unk> out of my own children and the world around me.
<unk> <unk>, then you don't <unk> a <unk>.
After this <unk>, it looks like I was born in a world that someone like me has no <unk> <unk>.
But today, I'm <unk> for <unk> and <unk> that <unk> my life.
So, I <unk> immediately in online <unk> from <unk>, I wanted to find a <unk> <unk>.
Here's new <unk> of <unk>.
<unk>, there's nothing better.
<unk> two words, from the <unk> <unk> <unk>, I'm <unk>, "the whole" <unk> "and" <unk>. "
It's not just the words are the problem.
What we think about people that we call in this way.
It's about <unk> behind the <unk> and how we build them.
Our <unk> affect our <unk> and the way we see the world and others.
In fact, a lot of <unk> <unk>, including <unk> and <unk>, <unk> that a <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> was very powerful, because when I was <unk> it was <unk> to be.
So what do we want to create?
A person who has a powerful person?
In fact, in <unk> that we call a child, you might <unk> the power that it has.
Is it better for a <unk>?
It was also a man who <unk> my <unk> in <unk>, from <unk>, from <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
His name is <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of <unk> named it seems that it's too hard to <unk> Americans.
So he said <unk>.
<unk> always <unk> <unk> and had <unk> <unk> to work with kids.
It has spent time in the hospital with <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I wanted to do the <unk> <unk> with these <unk> <unk> <unk>, to <unk> my <unk> from my legs.
You get out of all those <unk>.
They <unk> them.
I was five years old, I was <unk> to <unk> to <unk> to <unk> those <unk>, of course, without <unk>.
<unk>, came to my <unk>...
There were some <unk> <unk> and <unk>...
and he said, "<unk>, you are such a powerful <unk>," I think I'm going to get one of these <unk>. "And when I'm going to <unk> it, I'm going to give you a 100 dollars." And this was the <unk> <unk> <unk> to make me <unk> that I'm going to be the most <unk> years of two <unk> years of the <unk>.
But what he did was to <unk> a <unk> <unk> in a new experience.
And I wonder, and today, as the fact that I was a powerful <unk> of the way I see today, as a <unk>, as a powerful person.
This is an example of <unk> in which <unk> <unk> power can <unk> the power of a child.
But by those <unk> of the <unk>, our language doesn't allow us to create the reality that we all want, to be able to <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> is not <unk> to climate change, many of them being <unk> by technology.
I think, from a <unk> <unk>, my legs, <unk> with <unk> for <unk> and <unk>, who allow them to <unk> value to <unk> and <unk>, which allow people to <unk> value to <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of nature, so that they don't talk to the online <unk>, that allow people to <unk>, so that they can <unk> to <unk> groups, so that they can <unk> to <unk> groups, so that they can <unk> them.
Maybe the technology is <unk> now now <unk> what's true.
It means that every man has something <unk> and powerful <unk> <unk>, and that the human ability to <unk> is the largest <unk> <unk>.
human rights to <unk> is an interesting thing, because people are always going to talk about <unk> <unk>, and I'm going to make you a <unk>.
I never loved this <unk>, and I <unk> with <unk> to people about it.
I think I began to understand why.
<unk> in the <unk> problem is, and the idea that <unk>, or happiness means <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> without this, like my life in the ability to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> with <unk>, or what other people see like my <unk>.
But in fact, in fact, is, of course, we are <unk> a physical challenge or <unk>.
I want to think this is a good thing.
<unk> is not a <unk> that we need to <unk>, so that we can live <unk> life still.
<unk> part of our lives.
I think it's sort of a <unk> of my <unk>.
Sometimes, I see a pretty much, <unk> less, but it's always with me.
I'm not trying to <unk> the impact of one person with <unk>.
In life there are <unk> and <unk> for each of us, but the question isn't whether you're going to <unk> this <unk>, but the way you will <unk> to it.
So our <unk> is not just <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to the people that they were <unk>, but to try to <unk> with it.
We make a <unk> of children, when we do them to <unk> the <unk> of <unk>.
There's an important <unk> between the fact that I have <unk> a <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk>, if I or not a <unk>.
And in order to be <unk>, the only real <unk> I've been the fact that the world would be <unk> by those <unk>.
From our <unk> to <unk> the people that we <unk>, the truth about <unk>, or <unk> about the quality of the future of their lives, we need to take care to <unk>.
It means that you only see what's in <unk> with you can be much more <unk> than the <unk> <unk>.
Because they don't <unk> the person in her <unk>, and they don't <unk> them another other problems they have.
<unk> <unk> the <unk> of that human in society.
So we need to look through the things that is <unk> a human.
And especially, they form a <unk> between those <unk> <unk> and the biggest <unk> <unk> of our <unk>.
We don't have to <unk> or <unk> these <unk>, to <unk> them or <unk> them or to <unk> them, but to find the <unk> that they have <unk>.
The idea that I want to <unk> is not only to <unk> the <unk>, but also to think about it, to <unk> it, to <unk> it, to <unk> it, to use a <unk> term, maybe actually <unk> with it.
And maybe we'll see <unk> as something natural, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, something that doesn't <unk> our <unk> down.
In this year, the <unk> <unk> <unk> for 200 years, and <unk> years ago, when I was talking about <unk>, <unk> <unk> a <unk> about the human <unk>.
To <unk>, not the most powerful species and <unk> the most <unk>, but that can <unk> to change.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
From <unk> <unk>, among others, we can see that human ability to <unk> and to <unk> is <unk> the <unk> <unk> to the human <unk>, from <unk> to <unk>.
Again, <unk>, <unk> is the largest human <unk>.
And maybe, until we're <unk>, we don't know why we are able to.
Maybe this gives us <unk>: a <unk> of <unk>, the <unk> of our <unk> <unk>.
So we can do alone a <unk>.
We can <unk> <unk> as something more than some <unk> <unk>.
We can see it as a change.
<unk> is the change that we haven't yet.
I think the biggest <unk> I've <unk> is the idea of <unk>.
Who is normally?
There's no <unk>.
There are <unk> <unk>, <unk>, but not <unk>.
And do you really want to <unk> a <unk> like that?
I don't think.
If we can change this <unk> from <unk> to <unk> to <unk> or <unk>, to say a little bit more, we can <unk> the <unk> of many children, and we can <unk> their <unk> <unk> in the community.
The <unk> tell us that the only thing we humans, we asked them from <unk> <unk> was to be <unk>, so that they can <unk>.
And he found that people in <unk>, <unk> years ago, he <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> and the ones with physical <unk>, and maybe because their <unk> to <unk> to <unk> the community.
They don't <unk> these people as <unk> or <unk>.
They were <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
A few years ago, I was in a market in my <unk> town, in that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and I was looking at a box of <unk>.
It was <unk>. I was in <unk> <unk>.
I've heard the voice of a man behind me, "<unk> to be, if it's not really <unk>." And I went back and I saw a <unk> that he didn't know.
I said, "I'm <unk>. Do you <unk>? I remember." He said, "You know how to be <unk> to be <unk>."
"When we met, we just a <unk> in your mother to <unk>."
So he was.
And I <unk> it.
The man was <unk>, a man I just knew from my <unk> <unk>, because, like <unk>, I came to the world with a couple of weeks.
And the <unk> of my <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
So the one who helped to my <unk> on the world was a <unk> for my parents.
And because I was born without <unk>, because I had <unk> my legs, and just a few <unk> to legs, he had to give them the <unk>.
She said, "We had to tell the <unk> of <unk>," you will never go "" and "that you will never go" "and that you would never have the <unk> that they have other children," "or a <unk> life."
"But you have <unk> <unk> that I <unk>." What's <unk> is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> in which we came from <unk>, I still out of the <unk>.
When I <unk> the <unk> <unk> in the second, when I was with the other <unk> in <unk> <unk>, when I took the <unk> to <unk> or my <unk> <unk>.
He's <unk> the <unk> example, <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
And the course of <unk> <unk>, "<unk>," <unk> human <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> couldn't stand in the <unk> <unk>, like <unk> in quality of life.
And <unk> said to me, "In my <unk>, if he doesn't say <unk>," and if he's got to <unk> and the <unk> <unk>, "if it's <unk> to do what he wants, a child will make <unk>."
<unk> made that change in <unk>.
He understood that there's a difference between <unk> <unk> and how someone <unk> in it.
And my <unk> has changed over time.
If I was asked for 15 years, if I gave you the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, I would not be <unk> any second.
At that time, I was looking at that kind of <unk>.
If I do today, I'm not that safe.
And that's the <unk> <unk> we had with them, and not, "<unk> of them."
Maybe this change in me has been <unk> because I was <unk> to more people who open <unk> me than those of open <unk> them in the face.
So, you see, you don't need than one person to have <unk> <unk> <unk>, and you're on the way the good way.
If you can give the <unk> of his <unk>, the human <unk> is so <unk> -- if you can do that, and you can do that, and we <unk> them a <unk> at a <unk> moment, I'm <unk> him as to.
He <unk> his own <unk>.
In fact, the word "<unk>" has <unk> <unk>. "
You want to put in <unk> what's inside, to <unk> in <unk> value.
So, <unk>, what do we want to <unk> in <unk>?
It was a study in Britain, in Britain, when they went from <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
It's about <unk> <unk>.
I'm a <unk> <unk> with <unk>, with <unk>, with <unk>, etc.
And they had a <unk>, the best teachers, the best teachers, etc.
<unk> for three months, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>, and they were told that they were <unk>.
<unk> this period of three months, they had <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> was that <unk> <unk>. He was told that I was <unk> <unk>.
And that happened after three months.
Some of them were in school. <unk> <unk> to studies.
The <unk> <unk> of this study is that the teachers have been <unk>.
They didn't realize that.
She was told who <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
And they <unk> the <unk>.
I think the only <unk> is a <unk> <unk>, which is no longer <unk>.
You can't see the <unk>.
It doesn't have the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If, instead, we can <unk> the <unk> of a man to <unk> his <unk>, to see the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk>, it means that we're using the power as we use.
When a <unk> has those <unk>, we can create new <unk> and new ways to be.
I want to share you with a <unk>, <unk> by a <unk> <unk> in <unk> named <unk>, which was my <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> is called "<unk>" which is just four words. "
"Every child met God." "" <unk>, "<unk> of God," he's not God's <unk>, "but a God who's only four words and everything," but a God knows only four words and all of them, '' <unk> with me. "
"<unk> and <unk> with me." Thank you.
